review_title: By far the worst phone I have ever owned
review_text: I have had this phone for 4 months. It drops calls constantly, does not deliver text messages, doesn't get good service (I have Verizon), shuts off randomly, deletes contacts, takes FOREVER to do the simplest things.... Overall it is the worst phone on this entire planet, and I am currently begging around for a flip phone to use until my contract is up. Verizon lied to me about having a rebate on this phone (it's not even eligible) and it's a pain to even own. I leave it dead for days at a time because it's not even worth electricity to charge it.

review_title: I wish it worked!
review_text: I have a cell phone that rarely has a signal and drops calls all the time when I have a signal strong enough to make/receive a call. The data is constantly not available. If I could return this phone I would but unfortunately I did not make the cut off date because I was out of state for my Grandfathers funeral. This phone didn't work any better in any of these states Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah or South Dakota. Its a shame to pay so much money for a phone you can not rely on.

review_title: Terrible phone, do not purchase for your own sake
review_text: I have had this phone for about 8 months already and I am fed up. I consider this a severe downgrade from my previous phone in terms of the quality and the functions it offers. Why? 1. This phone will RING ON MAX VOLUME every 5 minutes telling me and the rest of the world that it has low battery... EVEN WHEN IT'S SET ON SILENT. You'd expect Samsung can make a decent phone by now that stays silent when it's put on silent. 2. You can't customize the home screen and barely any other settings. You're basically stuck with the features that has been pre-set for you. 3. This phone will magically unlock itself in your pocket or in your bag and find a way to call every contact on your list. 4. While I'm in the middle of a call, my cheek can EASILY end the call with the softest touch. I can say that 25% of my calls are ended because my cheek accidentally hit the end call button on the touch screen. 5. The phone randomly restarts itself as it pleases. Bottom line: If you're looking for an affordable phone that functions normally, SKIP THIS. This phone will drive you insane. I am grieving the fact that I'm in a 2-year contract with this phone and I'm taking time to write this review to save potential customers from the same awful fate.

review_title: Very unhappy with Samsung Intensity II
review_text: I have had to replace the phone twice already and will be replacing it again tomorrow. The phone keeps freezing or going completely dead. When it dies, usually in the middle of the night while sitting on a table, it won't allow me to turn it back on. I have to pull out the battery. Saturday the phone froze, something I didn't realize until I had a minor situation and needed to make a call. Driving down the road is not the time to be trying to remove a hard case and pull out a battery to reset the phone. I got the phone about 25 - 30 days ago. At one point the cell phone company kept the phone for half a day and reloaded the software. It froze about a week later. I would love the phone IF it worked properly. I would switch to another phone but the cell phone company will only move me to a cheaper phone with fewer features.

review_title: My Samsung
review_text: I am a fan of Samsung and have been for some time. but this phone I do not like.. if you are a girl or a guy with very small hands.. then you might like it. The camera on it is not that good, it doesn't do video, The software for it to connect to PC is not that good and took about 4 times to plug and unplug into my sys before it finally started working right. My system is 64bit Windows 7, The lock buttons are a pain in the behind. I set it to one button unlock and it always seems to be the first button hit when in my pocket. and when I go to even answer a call I have to unlock first and usually end up hitting 2 or 3 buttons at once and it hangs up the call. I would not recommend this phone to anyone with man hands..lol I can't wait to get rid of it.

review_text: I've had this phone for about three months now. I was very exited with it until a couple of days ago, it started to get slower and froze many times. Also, the send button isn't reacting to my click. Another thing and the most important thing is, I can't receive calls from anyone. I called myself with a different phone. the other phone was calling me perfectly. however, I did not receive it. All of my SAMSUNG phones have broken, but i wanted to give SAMSUNG another try. But I now know...I will never buy a SAMSUNG product again... EVER!!!

review_title: Red Samsung Galaxy S3
review_text: Battery life has a glitch. Cell Standby ate 65% of my phone battery. Have to turn off all the fantastic features to have any kind of phone. I hope we get a fix soon, because I love this phone and would like to keep it. I am so disappointed. My ratings are all poor because it doesn't work without the battery.

review_title: Starts out good -- but just wait until replacement after just nine months. :(
review_text: This phone was adequate; but after nine months phone started shutting off when battery life was still 80 percent. When you restart battery is then down to 1 percent. This make the phone totally unreliable! And after reviewing the Sprint forum, it seems like this is a recurring issue for many, so it's a manufacturing defect, not an isolated issue. Someone needs to step up and take responsibility. New purchasers beware!

review_title: Nobody should take price this seriously
review_text: As a happy Galaxy S user for over 2 yrs, when I needed a new phone I only looked at Samsung. Verizon wanted a small fortune for the Galaxy S III, but also had the Galaxy Stellar for a much more reasonable price so I took it. Huge mistake -- this cheezy gadget should not even have the Galaxy name on it. On paper it may seem like a solid mid-range phone, but living with it for a few days proves otherwise. Comparing it to the Galaxy S series is like comparing a roller skate to a Porsche. Signal quality is horrid. Sound quality is poor. The screen is barely clear enough for icons, forget anything detailed, and overly sensitive to touch. The built-in storage is very limited, and although it can accept an SD card it can only be used for music/pictures. It has a second camera for skype chats (hello! its a phone!) but the main camera has no flash and takes poor pictures. Overall feel is that of a toy. Do yourself a favor, especially if you're getting stuck in a 2 yr contract: spend the money on a real Galaxy.

review_title: Many apps do not work, often freezes
review_text: I have had to go to store many times due to frequent freezes. All they ever did was factory reset. and nothing helped. It took a year before the OS was upgraded, and still never helped. I became a pro at opening the case to take out battery as that was the only way I could re-start the phone. Some apps never did work on that phone. I have put FB back to the original installed version; I have done its upgrades, FB NEVER would load on this phone. About 1/3 of news sites that I downloaded apps for crashed and never would run. Cannot see the screen at ALL when outdoors. And many apps are not compatible and cannot even be gotten. The on-screen keyboard is tiny, and even after I bought a stylus, was unable to text on the thing. I hate this phone. So; yesterday, I upgraded at Verizon to S3. I LOVE the S3. But don't spend your money on a Continuum!!!

I'm a recruiter and work daily with social media but this phone was too much even for me. There was so much flashing and the ticker on the bottom kept going so often that I actually found it all too distracting and wound up turning off almost all of the features that made me want the phone to begin with.

I have checked the battery and it is fine. Sometimes when I get done typing a text and I slide the phone shut it turns itself off. I don't understand it.

review_title: Decent but buggy
review_text: I got this phone with my last contract renewal with Verizon. The phone layout is pretty good but it is a little buggy. Cleared messages / voicemail notifications frequently reappear and it occasionally freezes up completely. Lags a little when using the browser and certain apps. Search uses Bing only. Not a fan. Preloaded Verizon media apps (Vcast) are garbage. There are also a few other preloaded apps that are nothing more than a waste of memory. Overall, the phone is decent but could use some improvements.

review_title: Overall good phone
review_text: The design is great and overall it is a very good phone. Biggest problem so far is that it will lag at times or fail to open messages the first time. I believe performance could be improved with the updated OS, but not sure if that will ever happen. Size of the phone is perfect. Resolution on the display is amazing. Battery life is acceptable. If you plan on heavy use, make sure you have the ability to charge it with you. Under normal use, I can make it through the day without any problems. Like most smartphone, it needs to be charged nightly.

review_title: Dead Before Its Time
review_text: This is my first smartphone. It is a good phone, with some good features. The Ticker was a good selling feature for me, along with the lower price than the Fascinate. The phone has decent space for apps and operates fairly reliably. Battery life is short, less than 20 hours for basically standby use, but that is most likely no different than most smartphones. I rated it in the midrange mostly because of the promise to upgrade it to 2.2, which appears to be dead in the water, now. This upgrade would have improved batter usage, given access to Flash, as well as more apps. Apps are being developed for 2.2 and later, so as time goes on, this phone will be more and more obsolete. If this update had gone out, as promised, the marks would have been higher. Overall, it is a decent phone, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because of the, now, lack of upgrade support. I would recommend a newer phone with 2.2 or 2.3 already installed.

review_title: It's OK I guess.
review_text: This is my first smartphone so I don't have much to judge against but in my opinion the battery lasts well and the screen is nice and bright. There is no convenient way to shut down APPs. I don't like that. The range for voice and 3G are not the best. My wife and son both have LG phones with better range than mine.

review_title: Great Phone with an old version of Android
review_text: I like this phone. Just two complaints. The battery needs to last a little longer and the Android operating system is old. The newest version is 2.3 and this still has 2.1. You should at least upgrade your customers to 2.2. 2.1 doesn't fully support push notifications, and this is a great feature that many apps now have. Come on Samsung, get with it and update your software for this phone.

review_title: Lack of support killed my phone
review_text: I would love to write a glowing review of how I love this phone but one main issue is stopping me... lack of support. Since I bought this phone December of 2010 they have had not Android updates and it doesn't appear they intend to. This phone was basically out of date the moment I walked out of the store. Friends who bought other brands of phones at the same time are running 2.2 or even 2.3 but no, we're stuck with slow glitchy 2.1 for the next 2 years of my contract. I have to say I love the design, the screen is great and vibrant.

The headphone jack is on the curved part of the phone so if your headphone jack is larger like on some nice over the ear headphones dont expect it to fit all the way in, you'll have to buy an adapter to listen to music...

review_title: My Continuum
review_text: I bought my 1st Continuum and had it for about a month. It got very ill and I took it into my phone service provider. It could not be fixed so I got a second. After 4 days with the 2nd it got ill and had to be replaced. I am now on my 3rd. So far so good. I will say that I spent many hours on text chat with Samsung with the 2nd phone and they worked very hard to try and resolve my issues. I did spend many hours with my phone service providers both on the phone and online and everyone was helpful and tried very hard to fix the problems that I ran into. I had high hopes for this phone, from all the info I could read and other customers who owned the Continuum. As my 3rd Continuum is still new (less than 2 weeks) I am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping that I just happened to get the 2 out of what 50,000 that were produced that had problems. I do wish the case were made of heavier plastic. I still feel that I have to be very careful when putting it down or holding the phone. Other than that when they have worked, call clarity is super! Getting to know what settings I prefer for what took just moments. I do miss not having a missed call reminder, but then again, I could have it and not know it's there yet. Overall I am enjoying the phone.

review_title: Ok if you're looking for a cheap phone
review_text: Overall this is a good phone. I had an iPhone 4 before so this phone was a downgrade but the savings on my phone bill make up for it. The camera is not bad for the price but compared to other smart phones it is seriously lacking. No flash and not much zoom. Pictures don't appear too grainy when looking through them but I don't know if they would be print quality like the iPhone. I love the Android software and the features. I think it's way better than Apple. All the pre-loaded apps are awesome, you can do so much with this phone. It does run very slow though, it seems to get bogged down quickly and doesn't have enough RAM to run all the cool programs it comes with. Overall I like this phone better than my iPhone but I wish it had a better camera, faster processor and more internal memory.

review_title: GOOD DEAL just a couple of isues
review_text: I recently bought this phone, I like the design a lot and I am satisfied in general. There are just a couple of problems I have found so far but I'd like to begin with the Pros: Good features for an inexpensive android, light, good signal, good sound, pretty quick for a 800MHz. Battery life is just Ok. I would have rated this phone 4 stars except for: NO FRONT CAMERA (I skype a lot), small screen, no photo flash; two quirks that have popped up and the clock "freezes" not giving the correct time.

review_title: Two glaring problems
review_text: My elderly mom has used this phone for the past six or eight months or so. Before that she had the Samsung Knack which is virtually the identical phone. Both phones work well and are fairly well suited for the person who wants a no-frills, basic, easy-to-use phone. For the most part, the display is easy to see. The ability to adjust font size is very helpful, however, the largest size isn't quiet large enough for an elderly woman with limited sight. The buttons are easy to use. Occasionally the menu requires the user to hit a button twice for confirmation which can be kind of confusing. For example, in order to listen to a voice mail message, you need to select the message, then select it AGAIN to "listen." There are two glaring problems with the Samsung Haven, both of which were carried over from the Knack. First of all, the side-mount buttons are on the main body of the phone rather than on the flip-up display. It's virtually impossible to handle this phone without pressing one of the side buttons by mistake. The only way to keep from pressing a side-mount button by mistake is to hold the phone by the display, and I don't know of ANYONE who holds their flip-phone that way! Due to this poor design, on several occasions my mom has inadvertently lowered and/or turned off the volume to the point that she missed important phone calls. It's very disconcerting to check in on my mom and get no answer, which leads me to think something is wrong, when in fact, the ringer was just turned off. I just hope if she ever CAN'T answer her phone because she's hurt or something, that I don't shrug it off assuming the ringer is turned off again. The other big problem is the fact that the battery just doesn't last. The only reason she got rid of her Samsung Knack is because the battery died and it would have cost more to get a new battery than to get a new phone! The same goes for her Samsung Haven. She's had her Samsung Haven for not quite a year, and here I am looking for a new phone for her again because her battery is about to die! Now that I'm in the market to replace her Samsung Haven, I'd really like to find a better, more well-designed phone for my mom. Unfortunately, having to learn how to use a new phone would be so difficult for her, that she'd much rather overlook the problems and have me buy another Samsung Haven, than find a phone better suited to her needs.

review_text: This phone is pretty good. It has a few querks and a few missing features that I wish it had in comparison to my other phone. I am having problems hooking the phone up to my computer to transfer music onto the SD card so I can listen to music on my phone. Also, this phone does not allow you to take video's. Another weird querk is that the phone will not allow you to put items on the calender for days that have already passed. Finally, when I connect my bluetooth to the phone, I hear high pitched whines in the background of the bluetooth when there is a silence.

review_text: The radio in the phone is poor. The response for the service between networks, as well as updates a limited not timely and service issues especially with SPRINT PRLS not functioning properly. Speed of phone is fine processor wise, overall multi-tasking performance is good. Light weight which is nice, but that's about it.Nothing special here.

review_title: Does NOT work 100% with Ford SYNC systems
review_text: The phone seems to work pretty good so far except 1 thing. I have a car with the Ford SYNC system. The phone will pair with the car, and download the phonebook with no problems, and apps like pandora work too. BUT. The texting feature is not compatible with Ford SYNC. The older galaxy, it worked fine, but this new phone, it no longer works. If you drive a car with the SYNC system, beware, it will NOT be 100% functional in your car unless Samsung fixes the issue. You will only be able to use the phonebook and bluetooth. Thats it. This is a shame because the Ford SYNC system was helping drivers keep their eyes on the road by letting the car send the text while talking to it. This is a step in the wrong direction.

review_title: Nice Phone
review_text: I went through 2 of these phones before the 3rd one worked. It has pretty much the same software has the Galaxy, but has a lower end camera with no flash. I like this phone because I wanted a smaller phone, and I did not need the fancy camera. The first two phones would not stay powered on. They shut off on their own, and froze. I'm very happy with the 3rd phone and works great. Must have had bad batch shipped from the factory. I would rate this phone higher if it were not for the first two DOA phones.

review_title: A few tweaks from being an excellent phone
review_text: I recently upgraded to this phone from my galaxy S for the new android OS and 4g speeds. However I did not realize all that I would be giving up with the "upgrade". The Good -Excellent phone call clarity -Perfect size for one handed use -Excellent display (wouldn't call it bright however) -Fast The Bad -Swype was perfect in the Galaxy S, I didn't even have to look at my phone half the time. With the Stellar I have to manually type words in because it will auto correct to ridiculous suggestions. I have tried adjusting the sensitivity but nothing seems to work. Frustrating that it worked so well on another phone. -4gb internal storage. I know it sounds like plenty especially with an expansion slot, but this phone does not support (or I can't figure out how to get it to) moving Apps to the external SD card. Keep in mind that by the time Samsung and Verizon put all their software on the phone internal storage is less than 1 gb. For anyone who likes to listen to internet radio, use maps, play games on their phone you will be constantly filling up the internal memory. Conclusion - Overall good phone (great for the price) and a solid basic smartphone. I would recommend to anyone looking for a basic smart phone with all the bare-bones essentials.

review_text: Overall the Stellar is a good device. It has some kinks and such with how the OP System works with Apps. And with dual cameras i'd think at least the main back camera would have a flash (LED) or something. The BEST feature is how you set up the menu, adding and deleting screens is easy and fluid. Along with Widgets and Apps, adding them to any screen is very easy, as well as deleting them.

Fast, reliable, and easy to use. has a starter mode for smart phone newbies and a standard mode for experienced smart phone users. It has lots of features that can be found on more expensive phones.

review_title: Works Well for Me
review_text: The Samsung Galaxy Stellar has the features I like: 4G, wifi, wide choice of apps, good speakers, pocket carrying size, responsive touch screen, and great battery life. It is a little intimidating with many menus and submenus that would be eased a little with a more detailed quick start guide. There is not much you can't do with it, such as GPS navigation, voice commands, note taking, or Web searching (and these are just the preinstalled apps). Overall, an excellent choice for those users not needing a higher level phone and, it has Samsung behind it. All is not rosy as the camera could be better.

review_title: Mini Galaxy SIII
review_text: For what it is, this is a fairly nice device. It has the same processor from the Galaxy SIII, but clocked a bit lower. It's a snappy phone with great speed. The only things that I would change about this phone is to upgrade the display to an AMOLD display like the Stratosphere has and I would make the case sturdier with aluminum instead of plastic. I can't complain too much though, upgrading from the Stratosphere means better processor, my Facebook app actually works now and it's free with a 2 year contract agreement.

review_title: A bit small, but...
review_text: I have big hands, so the on screen texting is a bit of a hassle, but the phone works very well. It is pretty snappy for a 1.2Ghz dual core CPU. Android 4.0.4 (ICS) is much better than Gingerbread was. For someone with average size hands, I'd say this is a good buy for a simple smartphone. It's not in the same league as the S III, but neither is its price and that's a plus as well...

I got this prepaid at Best Buy and it is ROCK SOLID. No freeze ups, works pretty fast for 3G, call quality is fine.

review_title: Not quite ready - bad fit and finish
review_text: I think this could be a great phone. Mine came with a cover that has a bad tab on it, so it doesn't fit quite right. Aside from that, there have been a handful of bugs with Bluetooth and some apps that don't quite run as smoothly as they did on my prior Droid phone. Also, the physical home button is a pain, especially since it wakes up the phone. I have to set a more difficult unlock sequence so that my phone doesn't wake up and do something if that button gets depressed in the pocket. Volume control is a bit jumpy as well. Phone performance is great, though!

review_text: Overall this is a good phone. I use it for business and it easy to use and navigate. However I have some major issues with emails and phone calls. First with calls, people tell all the time that the phone just cuts out for 5 seconds in the middle of the call. It doesn't happen on every call but it happens at least 5 times a week. Second with corporate and personal emails, the emails do not push down automatically. I have changed the settings and the settings keep changing back. Could be with the carrier but it does work when I click on the refresh button.

But there are con's are there, like it heats up while using mobile networks (live video/audio streaming), stock mail apps are not that great (which is very very important for me), Simple stock CLOCK alarm won't work if its vibrate mode! Those are some to list but over all I am happy to begin with though!!!

review_title: Software Flaws
review_text: I am no stranger to Mobile devices. I have went through the Iphone 4s, Galaxy S3, Iphone 5, Galaxy note II and now upon the Galaxy S4. I will say the S4 is not my FAVORITE out of all my phones, and let me explain why. Going from the Galaxy S3 to the Note II was a big difference. In the terms of having multiple windows open at a time, picture quality was outstanding, and the size was much different. Now going from the Note II to the S 4, feels like I actually downgraded. Smaller and slimmer was nice, but overall there was nothing really new. Yes, it has smart auto stay and auto scroll. Honestly, the scroll has major flaws, and does not accurately read your eyes. The auto stay, for pausing the video when you look away is a nice idea, however, it still pauses even when you are looking at the screen. Overall, not very impressed with the Galaxy S4, just hope it doesn't turn in how apple updates their products. By that, adding a 5 and updating to 4g, which was long overdue. Come on samsung, you're better than this, hopping for an update soon, to provide additional feature. Fingers crossed to get 4.3 in the near future. ( hint ) and maybe I can get my hands onto the Galaxy Note III here in the future. Will say, if you want more for your money, the Note II or the new Note III will be the way to go. :)

review_title: Amazing equipment for a 1st time smartphone user
review_text: My kids were always bugging me to upgrade from my flip phone, but I didn't see the need to spend money on technology I would never use. I bought the S4 days before my vacation and must say that it was easy to learn, great to stay connected to family and friends while I was away, and the GPS and Google Maps were invaluable! I should have done this sooner. I do find this a little large to carry in pants pockets and my only serious "con" is that the speaker is on the back of the phone, which just doesn't make sense when you are using the front!

review_title: Best phone ever but.
review_text: This is the best phone I have owned hands down. It is very fast &amp; full of features with a large display. Every program that I have installed has run flawlessly with no problem whatsoever. The only negative thing about this phone that I really dislike is the expandable sd memory. It's expandable to 64gb sd which is useless, because the phone only reads programs from internal memory which is 16gb. I installed two games and now, have less than 5gb left so I have to play these games, uninstall them, and put new games on. I have a 32gb sd card but you don't have the option of moving apps to the sd card which doesn't make any sense. Keep in mind that I have had this phone only a couple months, so I don't have a lot of apps on the phone, just a couple games and apps. The less than 5gb is a lot of programs that come on the phone, so that limits the programs that I can install without having the option to move to the sd card.

review_text: I've had it for a few months now, and other than the major annoyance of the PTT always getting hit when I open it, it's a darn good phone. I like the camera - simple and with decent light, it takes good pictures. And I've already dropped it a couple of times and it came through with no problems. Other than a bit bulky, it's ideal for me.

review_title: iNTEGRATION...
review_text: Overall great durable phone. doesnt drop calls and is as tough as nails. the mobile e-mail capability is a little weak and the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars. i know it isnt a smart phone but it should at least allow outlook e-mail to work...Especially considering its more of a fleet phone for business.

review_title: Will not Bluetooth
review_text: Phone takes nice pictures, is loud enough to hear when out doors, connects to phone calls well, longer battery life, but it will not connect via Bluetooth to my car or my ipad. Other than another AT&amp;T phone, I have not been able to connect it to anything. When I called AT&amp;T about how to connect it to my car, they told me it does not have the same Bluetooth, to call my car company. I suppose they would tell me to call Apple also. Bummer, other than that, it is a very nice phone.

review_title: Galaxy S III problems
review_text: I have found far fewer problems with the S II. The Svoice feature has communication problems far more often than it actually works. The voice command related to the keyboard will fail to connect with Google almost every time. The concept for functionality is genius but the software designed to implement the actions are too intricate for the phone to follow the internal commands. Hopefully there will be an update that will correct these issues but if I had it to do over again I would probably go with the S II

review_title: Feature Phone but would have been better
review_text: First time coming to Samsung Phone from my Other brand Android Phone. First of with all the Pros, Its Light weight, Colorful, Fast with all great features for a next gen smartphone. Of all Phones i had this one has best Voice Quality. Display is one of great feature with Brighter colors. Great Plus are replaceable Battery and add Micro SD card. Though it has all advance features, the quality of material is looks cheap especially the back cover of Phone. Also they advertise it as Gorilla Glass 2 but it gets crack easily and the display has finger prints on usage. Camera is 8MP but the picture quality is great in Sun light still images only. No image stabilization and not good at medium or low light and still not a replacement for normal point and shoot camera. It has huge battery capacity so i would expect at least 2 days between charges but have to charge everyday. If they remove lots of bloatwares, it would get expected Battery life. Build in HDMI would have been great instead of MHL which we need to buy it.

review_title: Nice display and fast operation
review_text: Overall I like this smartphone. Storage capacity is good and you can add a micro sd card for additional storage although you have to take the back cover off and remove the battery to install it. Talk time and overall battery life is poor. Barely gets me through an 8 hour day if I talk for 60 minutes on the phone. Needs a better over the air sync and backup method that is efficient to work with syncing with common desktop business software for contacts, notes and tasks. The one provided is slow and connecting via the usb is inconsistant and the wifi connection expects that the pc has a wifi on it so if you have a hardwired desktop pc it does not provide for a router wifi connection between phone and pc.

review_title: The more I use it the more I love it
review_text: It was a replacement, to a middle of the road get your toes wet smartphone. I am well known for breaking things including myself. It has been dropped, skid,and rained on etc,and knock on simulated wood grain... still ticking.. I loose control of my body at times, and things go flying. The apps available are helpful with catching some of the symptoms I miss, and have been so useful with Drs, I can hand off/or switch view the camera and catch things in action, with a tap of my finger, or a key word.

review_title: Good phone for the price
review_text: I purchased this phone as an upgrade to my last tracfone. I must admit I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out. I read all the reviews before purchasing it, and have not experienced the negative qualities that some other's have. One review mentioned the tiny keys and ease of accidently pressing the spacebar twice. I avoid this by tapping the side or edge of the spacebar key. The phone's features are pretty simplisctic, but I knew I wasn't purchasing a smartphone.

review_title: Great phone, but I've had some problems
review_text: The phone has all the features that I wanted and it will get the ICS update. It works on T-Mobile's HSPA+ 42Mbps network (8Mb down, 3Mb up in San Diego). I don't need or want LTE, so that is why I went with T-Mobile. I didn't get the Galaxy S III because frankly, it's too big. While it is state of the art, it wouldn't fit in my pockets and hands. I wanted a 4" device and this the Blaze was perfect. Now the bad. - There is no "stay awake" feature when connected to power/usb. I'm not sure why Samsung decided to remove that feature. I had to download an app, that doesn't work great. - I've had it for 1 week, and the phone did crash once. - Just now, I lost network registration while trying to make a call. I had to put it in/out Airplane mode to re-register on the network.

review_text: This phone is a great beginner phone(as a transition from a regular phone to a smartphone). I loved that it was small enough but still had a great display. The battery life is great and all my important apps run great! It is also inexpensive so that's a huge pro. The only con is the version of Android it runs on.

review_title: Almost a perfect phone... almost!
review_text: I came from an HTC Inspire looking for a bigger and better phone. I've never been more happy with a phone purchase before. It fits perfectly in my hand, the screen is beautiful and big so I can see and touch everything, my thumbs fit on the keyboard, and the best part: THE BATTERY LASTS ALL DAY LONG with full usage!!! Incredible phone. The S-Pen is genius. I love being able to take notes, write on pictures and so much more. Sure, it's a little big in your pocket, but you get used to it real fast. I don't wear tight pants, but I do wear fitted--the phone fits wonderfully. WHY FOUR STARS? The star came off because of a issue that I've been having with the phone. When I record video, the audio isn't guaranteed. I'm not sure if it's a software problem or if it's where the mic is located--because my fingers seem to always be there. So that design in flawed is my opinion. Everything else has been really incredible. I'm definitely going to be sticking with this phone model for the next few releases--unless Samsung reveal something better but same size! :)

review_title: Best phone on the market.
review_text: This phone is simply, the best phone i've ever had. It is fantastic. The big screen, customization, features are just what a phone needs to be amazing. The camera takes flawless pictures, and even more flawless videos. I would recommend this phone to anyone. It has something for everyone. The only thing that has me disappointed about the phone -and the reason I gave it an overall rating of 4, as well as in performance-, it's that it overheats all of the sudden -it may be for the NFC and S Beam capability it has-, and the battery doesn't last too long on a regular use, so make sure to keep your charger near -let's wait until they release the extended battery this spring-. This isn't very important, but the display brightness could improve a lot when it comes to using it on sunlight, since you can't barely see anything. I really love the design of the phone, yet, I think it can get much much better than this. Counting out the flaws it has. This has been the best phone i've ever got to hold.

review_title: Almost Perfect
review_text: I have Tmobiles Galaxy S3... PROS: I love the overall design of this phone. I have small hands so it fits in my hands nicely. I love the apps and widgets. I love the camera with all the features, love the live wallpapers, I love the smooth transition between screens and apps and the 3D appearance of the apps and the customizable features. Image quality is awesome, Watching movies on the device is great although I think the sound on movies could be improved to match the quality of the movie. The images on the 8 megapixel camera come out crisp unless you use the zoom then they can be somewhat hazy. Calling is clear most of the time unless you go somewhere that is not in range of a signal then it sometimes gets gargled CONS: The phone tends to get hot when its being charged in the car. Its supposedly 4g but it always seems lagging when it comes to getting onto the internet when I am not near a wi-fi signal. The gallery crashes when I try and sync facebook photos and picasa photos or if I have videos it lags and crashes. I hate the fact that it takes forever to get the firmware updates.

review_title: I really like my Note 3
review_text: I just want to said Samsung did a great job with the Note 3. I also own the Note 2. The Note 3 is way better. I just wanted to add a suggestion for the upcoming of the Note 4. Can you add the lock feature for contacts and text messages and photos. Like you have the lock feature in S Note. I really like that feature. Where if you let someone look at your phone they can not see your contacts or text messages or photos. That will be a awesome feature. You don't need certain individuals in your business. Just by letting them see your phone. Do not incorporate the finger print feature. Not everyone wants that feature or like it. Thanks SAMMY GREAT products

review_title: it's BIG
review_text: I've been a fan of Samsung for years, had the gs2, 3, galaxy 7 from tmobile, note 10.1 and have never been disappointed. this phone is a powerhouse, it's great at multitasking and the screen is big enough to multitask efficiently. the display is nothing less than I expected for the money I spent and the s-pen works very well, I wasn't sure what to expect as compared to my note 10.1. the only drawback is this thing is HUGE. Samsung did a great job of keeping the bezel slim to maximize the screen size without making it too bulky, but I have to wear cargo pants to fit it in a pocket. one feature I really like is the one handed operation. it will let you move the keyboard to one side or the other so you can easily type (or swipe) with your thumb, it's about a 2/3 size keyboard, otherwise there is no way I could text with one hand. overall i'm very impressed with the latest iteration from Samsung and will not hesitate to recommend it to others.

review_title: Missing two features
review_text: Although I'm pleased with this phone overall, it's missing two features that I would REALLY like. First, the phone I had before would leave the music controls on the front screen, even when locked, if I was listening at the time it locked. I could still pause or skip without entering my PIN. Second, my son's phone, from a different manufacturer, has an FM tuner built in. Since my gym used FM for the audio on all of the TVs around the room, this would be a huge plus. Since this is supposed to be Samsung's flagship phone, I'd expect it to have a tuner (I'm sure the chip is capable). Video is beautiful, the phone seems fast, and everything seems to run smoothly. I'm not dissatisfied, but I am a little disappointed.

However I think tracking my every move and reading my messages is wrong and intrusive. There should be a better way to develop a system that isn't so invading and be a bit more dignified in collecting the way it retrieves data from a clients personal list of trusted family and friends. I personally have experienced many intrusions of my personal contact lists on Google. I don't think It will end either.

So many features that are new to me like the heart-rate monitor that will help me in my wellness quest, the fingerprint scanner that adds extra security, the fact that I don't have to worry about accidental water damage (it has happened before with my S3) and the superior quality of the graphics and the camera have my mind blown.

review_text: This was a gift to a friend jobless and homeless. Not anymore! Samsung Smartphone and Verizon, connected him to old friends and contacts. Choosing to relocate from West Coast to Midwest, provided a place to stay, transportation to a new fulltime dream job with benefits, now a workaholic. Not a technology person, he took to the Samsung Stellar like a pro. Samsung and Verizon have helped me help a good man. Start a program, limit apps to networking, job websites, public transportation, navigation, maps, safety, shelter and a mentor. I dare both Samsung and Verizon

review_title: Stellar phone &amp; stellar value
review_text: This was my first smart phone I own outright (job provides one to me) and I can honestly say I love it more than many of the features listed on the Verizon website. It has 7 home screens although some reviewers said it had just 5. It has GPS, front &amp; rear cameras, loads of apps pre installed plus more features as well. It is marketed as a "starter" smartphone and even has the starter mode for beginners however this Stellar phone has just as many features as any other smart phone. It is clearly one of the most under rated phones in the Galaxy lineup including one of the under rated in the market. You cannot go wrong getting this phone!!! Performance suffered one star but thats due to Verizon NOT Samsung.

review_title: A very cool Android Phone
review_text: Let me start by saying that I love Samsung products. My boyfriend and i own several. I purchased a popular phone before getting this on from Verizon, well it was free and hated it. I returned it and got this little beauty. A wonderful little phone with so many great features. I have nothing but great things to say about Samsung products. The Galaxy Stellar won't disappoint. One of my favorite features is the call reject feature. It allows you to block numbers right from the phone without having to spend extra money for the call block service my carrier offers..

review_title: Cool! A smart cellphone!
review_text: First one to review a great smartphone! Samsung has done it again! My first cellphone was a Samsung years ago when cell phones first came out. I don't believe I will ever change to any other phone but Samsung. My Galaxy Stellar came out the first week of September and I have had it for 2 weeks now with no problems. It's my first smartphone and even though I am a techy person I waited for my cellphone service provider to change their data package offers to purchase a smartphone. Love the "Help" info for the phone available right on the phone (Just in case I need it!), the icons, navigation, screen size, the list goes on and on. Why buy a more expensive product for the same quality? My Samsung, THANK YOU!

Besides all of the great apps that are especially helpful to us as truck drivers there are other apps that are wonderful for recreation and downtime and great applications that you ll use everyday. I am still discovering new uses and new applications! I don't even need a book reader anymore! There are several free book reader applications that I have already tried that are terrific!! AND it is a prepaid phone!! I would recommend this phone to everyone!!! My only complaint is the battery LOL....the phone does so many things that I am using it almost constantly. I will be buying the backup battery and charger!!! It is worth it!!

review_title: Best Android Cell in the Marketplace
review_text: To start with, I have long nails, which with most touch phones, make it impossible to use. I didn't want a pull out keyboard. Just phone and that's it. I tried a number of different makes and models, including iphone. None worked for me. I read about Samsung Galaxy S, so tried it. It works great. It has Skype and you can even talk and it will write for you on emails and txts.The apps are endless. I finally found what I've been looking for.

review_text: Before purchasing the Galaxy sIII, i read as many reviews as I could on both the Galaxy and the Iphone. I found the Galaxy to be more user friendly. If you want more memory, just add it!

review_title: Great product, but confusing for a new user
review_text: I went from a POC (plain old cell) to a smartphone to replace my palm. This will do so much more, but some of the icons used in the software are confusing to me as I try to relate what my desktop PC uses and the Droid system uses other icons that I have problems deciding what they mean.

review_title: Fast phone!!
review_text: The phone operates very smoothly. No lag what so ever. On a previous phone that is all I experienced. And now the complete opposite. Motion: I have all of them enabled. The motion features are truly convenient and not just some gimmick. My favorite, while texting, making a call by moving to ear. Genius! Voice: I love the ability to answer/reject call while I'm doing the dishes or a task that prevents me from answering the phone, The speakerphone works great. While in a call there is an option to increase the volume further than the in-call volume. Another neat feature Called : Increase volume in pocket. This raise the sound of incoming calls. Battery: Battery lasts all day. Of course by first disabling certain features. Phone is off the charger at 7:30 AM and on at 7:00 PM I have wi-fi on all day and text, surf the web, download apps. Overall a great phone. Very easy to use and its intuitive.

review_title: Awesome!
review_text: The Samsung Galaxy III is amazing and I can't keep my hands off of it, it's beautiful! It's just the right size screen in my opinion 4.8" and the clarity of the screen is just gorgeous. I purchased the 16G white from Verizon. They didn't have the 32 in stock but I realized all I had to do is slip in my 32G microSd card and would have plenty of room left. It's "lightening" fast!!! This phone kicks butt over anything out there. The call quality is great and the features of the SG3 phone are very customizable and it's so easy to use. The phone is extremely thin, you would almost think it's frail but it's not. It has a central "home" button which is great and two other hidden buttons on either side. There is an extra added menu feature (left button) for just about any page which gives you way more options. I've used the "S Memo" and wow, you just have to use it to appreciate it. I also like the fact It will auto connect to my home WiFi or any WiFi in range to reduce data charges by itself. Pairing with my bluetooth was easy and just about every other thing you do with your "new" phone was a breeze to set up. OH and the Kies is awesome! Outstanding job Samsung!!! I absolutely LOVE my new phone!!!

review_title: Great Phone!
review_text: The Galaxy S3 on the Verizon 4g LTE network is a great phone from all angles. It has a big bright display, it's very fast and very lightweight for its size.

review_title: By far the BEST phone out!!!
review_text: The no lag on the camera is AMAZING and the picture taking WHILE recording vid is mind blowing for me. The screen may not be as fantastic as made out to be but its pretty good when it comes to videos. Without a doubt this phone exceeded my expectations. The camera is great, the speed and flow of EVERYTHING! You may pay a little extra than any other phone but its worth it! I cannot picture having a different phone except the Galaxy S4!!!

review_text: I got the S4 last May and it just gets better! I love the Samsung products and tell everyone they should check them out! The S4 takes awesome pictures, and I take a LOT of pictures of my grandchildren. The only thing I would like to see improve is the ability to share the animated and photos with sound. Other than that I love my Galaxy S4. The next Samsung product I want to get is a Samsung laptop.

review_title: Excellence by Samsung
review_text: I have been buyer Samsung products for close to 10 years. From TV's, Blu Ray DVD, Cameras, and now My S4. I have only had my S4 for a week, but I can go ahead and say it is the best phone I've ever had. The camera alone has more features than all the features of my last phone. My only con would be the battery life, just thought a battery of 2600mAh would last longer than 10 hours. Although that was 10 hours of constant use, this is the first battery of this size I've ever used. I will check back in a month from now to update my experience.

review_title: Works perfectly, don't hesitate to get yours now.
review_text: I was reluctant to buy because my 2 yr old smart phone was still working, but have not been disappointed. After 1 week, there has been no problems at all. Some of the important features for me are: nice large screen, works fast, never freezes, easy to operate, good instructions, very intuitive if you are an Android person. Only other consideration was Note 3, coming soon, but did not want to worry about a stylus. Tried all the fancy gimmicks, but many are unnecessary, phone works great, does everything just the way you want and expect it to. Removable battery and SD card are important features for me. Battery life is not bad, but I have ordered a cheap additional battery, for the occasional times when power is not available. Nothing has disappointed me about the phone so far.

review_title: POWERHOUSE!!
review_text: I'm completely in love with this phone! I was a worried at first that it might be too big but after holding it for a while really liked the size. The screen is by far one of the best on the market! I love the fact that the phone comes with a SD card slot unlike a lot of other phones on the market. Spen, multi-view, pop browser &amp; video player, and Sbeam are out of this world! The phone is very light and thin for its size. My only complaint is that on the rare occasions that i drop the phone, the battery cover pops off a little to easily. I'm talking about small drops here, like getting up from the couch and forgetting that the phone is on my lap...on to carpet.

review_title: Initial Reflections
review_text: I purchased this on 12/07/12. This was to replace an older android phone on Gingerbread level of the OS. The screen is excellent. Large as I wanted, playback of MPG files (after installing the appropriate App as the native movie app would not play standard mpg. Very speedy device. No hesitation moving between apps. Connects very quickly to my home wifi or work wifi. Good sound as well. Easy to connect to my Ford F150 SYNC via bluetooth and my bluetooth headset.

review_title: Great Phone!!
review_text: This is a great phone for the price. This is not an android phone, so don't buy it thinking it is. If you want an android phone then buy one. This phone does everything I need it to do. It will go online and access facebook and I use yahoo mail and it works to do that. It texts great, the sound quality is great. I have great service. I've always had full signal strength so far and no dropped calls. The camera works great as well. The keys are small, so if you have large fingers you might have trouble texting on it but I have no problem. It doesn't have a lot of games available but thats not problem for me because I don't play many games. It has a micro sd slot for its built in mp3 player. I haven't used the mp3 player yet, so I don't know how well that works yet. Overall this is an excellent phone and I would recomend it to someone looking for a basic phone at a good price.

review_text: Although my first phone wasn't an Android and this is probably my 4th phone since I was born, the leap in upgrading to a GS3 was just mind-blowing. No other phone has such fun, creative, useful features like the GS3 does. The idea of "designed for humans" was just the right thing to do, and it really is. "Inspired by nature"? Even the last micro-piece of it. Sounds, design, everything is just right... Never gonna change my mind.

review_title: great phone!
review_text: I love everything about this phone - the battery life is fantastic, I am able to use it as my primary portable music player, it has plenty of space for apps and things and a huge screen to boot! Be sure to get a good case for it, as it is not difficult to crack/break the screen, but the only real complaint I have is that I wish the headphone jack was on the bottom instead of the top. Fair warning - it is larger than the cell phone pocket in all of my purses and too big to carry in any of my wristlets, but I wouldn't want it to be any smaller.

review_title: Galaxy S III
review_text: Great smart phone, wish it was easier on the battery. Been setting it up and using for less than 24 hours and already have charged 2x. Thinking I may need to purchase an extra battery and charger to have on hand. Was hoping to not have battery issues but we'll have to see. I've been hooked up to WiFi, which should be easier on battery but isn't making alot of difference. Love the size of the screen without having a tablet stuck to my ear; however, needing to find a phone cover with a grippy surface as it does get tiring for me holding due to the width - someone with a larger hand may not have issues. All in all these issues are minor and I look forward to using this constantly.

review_title: Great tough phone
review_text: This is one great phone. Not being a texting person, I can't comment on that feature but the rest of the phone is great. Feels sturdy in my hand and is easy to use. Many selections on the options menu and allows you to choose customized features. The speakerphone is great and allows clear speech. Battery life seems excellent. Holds a charge for a very long time (several days) without charging. I would not hesitate to recommend this phone for anyone needing a phone to play music and make calls. The address book feature is really convenient.

review_title: The First Wave To Technological Future
review_text: This device is the best device to buy right now. It to me is even better than the Iphone 4S/5 and that's saying something. The 4g is strong and does not slow down the performance of the phone. I can have 4 hi-graphic apps in the background, a music app playing, a shoppers app in the background and take a phone call while checking my email and it still has enough power to run without lag. The features with the S-pen are amazing. To configure the pen to open programs with just a swipe or under your form of writing is cool and easy. I'm not crazy about the texting, but this is an everyday, all-purpose, multi-task, multi-functional phone. And I'm glad to be one of the few that own one

review_title: Samsung Galaxy Note 2
review_text: I switched from iPhone to the Note 2 and love it. Samsung Kies is similar to iTunes (but better). Kies and Easy Phone Sync made the transition easy. I couldn't get my text messages to transfer over without crashing it though. That is more of an Android con than Samsung. The weight of the phone is that of the smartphones a long time ago but at least this has a ton of features. I never knew how bad the sound quality on calls for the iPhone until I started using this. I can actually hear people when they call. The 16x9 ratio of the phone makes it look long and slim similar to that of a larger S3 but the Note 2 display is better. Multi view is out for at&amp;t. I'm kinda sad that it doesn't have the Samsung Dive or the FM transmitter like the international models. I'm eager for the dock to be in stock. I just wish that it had AllShare built into it. I don't consider this to be a phone. It's a portable entertainment system that supports multiple input , great display, great sound, and will make phone calls.

review_title: A little hard of hearing, this is the only phone to get!
review_text: If you are a little hard of hearing this is the only phone to get. There is a setting called Adaptive Sound. It gives you a hearing test by ear. It gives you a graph by ear, of the frequency leveles and shows you what you could hear if you let the Adaptive Sound feature correct for you. You can even select the default ear you hold your phone up to. I can now talk on the phone and don't have to askpeople to repeat themselves. Also I am hearing instruments on my favorite songs I never knew where there!

I usually get bored in the first year and usually I want to change my phone again. The Galaxy S4 is so amazing, I drop the phone three time already and nothing happened still works fine. I usually wash my phone instead of using a regular cloth, people looks at me like if I am crazy and usually they say "you not supposed to wash your phone" and I say "well my phone is waterproof, no problem" they get amazed.

review_title: Makes me love Samsung
review_text: I gifted myself a S.III last Fall. I am pretty happy with the phone. Looks sleek and elegant. Camera is good and the screen is entertainment friendly but not sun-friendly. The speaker id on the back, so the phone may turn kindda dumb when lying on bed. Internet connectivity is fast compared to lumia. I am little disappointed with battery performance. Sometimes it lasts a day and sometimes it drains in six hours with relatively same amount of work. It also heats up sometimes when battery is working out :D I like the USB OTG feature as I can use my flash drive with my S.III Its smart indeed. The looks of a white S.III seem to be like a cheap plastic thing but the pebble blue one is relatively cool. So I would suggest the blue one.

review_title: amazing phone for anyone
review_text: I have had my galaxy s3 for 7 months now and I love it. The device is super fast and very light for its size. Before I had the galaxy s3, I had an iPhone 4. I am SO glad I made the switch. The iPhone was slow, laggy, and heavy. But the galaxy s3 is nothing like the iPhone. The camera on the device is one of the best I have seen on mobile devices. It captures an exceptional amount of light and pictures are very clear and sharp. The screen on this phone is very good. It is very bright and very sharp. It is great for watching movies. The speaker on this phone is not very good. It goes loud, but it is not very clear when you turn it all the way up. The last thing I'm going to talk about is battery life. It is ok compared to other devices. The battery life lasts me around 11-12 hours with moderate use. If you use any extras like Bluetooth, GPS, or if you are streaming music, it will drain excessively. I can stream music from Pandora for about 8-9 hours. Other than these two con's the phone is amazing!

review_title: This may be the best of the best!
review_text: I really love this phone! Does it all and is a fantastic phone to boot. Only minor complaint I have is placement of volume control toggle...I constantly turn my ringer off! Real bummer. I'm hoping to train myself to grasp it differently. Screen is crisp and gorgeous, snappy responses, size and weight are amazing, plus the build quality is all there. This is my first nonapple smartphone and I'm happy with my decision to switch. I'm encouraging others to give it a try because I have been so pleased with my experience. Thanks Samsung

review_title: A Big Change
review_text: The story of me and my sgs3 starts about 2009 when I was deployed and my wife bought me an iPhone 3G. I came home and she surprised me with it. I am a tech junky and figured it out in about 2 weeks. I know, yes it took me that long. I was satisfied as it was my first smart phone and thought the world of apple products. Still do except for the whole iPhone and iPad thing. I am in the US Army and we transferred from Germany to western Louisiana back in the summer of 2012. We needed new phones and the only carrier with quality coverage here is AT&amp;T. We went to the mobile store here locally and were looking around for new phones, contracts and such. They had a great selection and we were browsing and I saw the typical iPhone displays. It screamed out to me, same ol same ol. Boring! The wife immediately knew what she wanted and that was an iPhone 4S. I was browsing and kept walking back over to the SGS3, which had just came out about a week or so earlier, before we returned from overseas. I had always joked and messed with my buddies who had androids. Operating systems with names such as Ice Cream Sandwich just dont bode well with manly men in the Army. I had never played around with androids so I had no idea how far superior they were to iOS. Well I poked around with it for about an hour or so before I made my decision and havent looked back at EYE anything. The SGS3 has surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds. I have had it for about 5 months and still find new things I didnt know about it. Going from iOS to Android is harder than going from a PC to a MAC. The features of the SGS3 are great. The only downfall I see with this phone is the battery life. I can overlook that though. It makes sense though with a processor that fast and the screen size. The display is much better on my Samsung than even the retina on the iPhone 4. I would definitely recommend this phone to a friend and now poke fun at the guys who dont have androids.

review_title: Samsung galaxy s3
review_text: I had a samsung Captivate and when my daughter talked me into getting an Iphone 4 which I did on my upgrade. The iphone is a good phone but just not as good as a Samsung. I am a huge Samsung fan, easy to use lots of things you can do with the Samsung phone that are not offered on other phones. User friendly. I just love all Samsung products. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 that I just purchased a couple of days ago and Love Love Love it. Been a while since I used a Android Phone so took me while to navigate thru the phone, but didn't take me long and now I remember stuff. Would Highly Highly recommend this phone along with any Samsung product. What Samsung says is what you get. Thanks Samsung

review_text: LOVE IT!!!! The phone fits great in four hand even though it has a 5.3 in. Love the multi window feature which lets you run two apps at once in the same screen. The S-pen works great. Love to text using the S-pen because the phone recognizes your handwriting in a second. Runs extra fast and smooth. Believe me, you will love this phone!

review_title: Best Phone I Have Ever Had!
review_text: The Features, The Pen and the things you can do with it and the Battery life Make this phone a True SuperPhone! With a 5.5 inch true HD Screen, 3300 mAH Battery, a 1.6 Ghz QuadCore Processor and Jelly Bean, What is there not to like about This ultimate Phablet. I just purchased the Galaxy S3 in September 2012 and as soon as the Note 2 came out I was sure I would fall in love with it so by December I made the switch, I just love big phones. The Galaxy S3 is an amazing phone as I said in my previous S3 review, but the added features with the SPen that the S3 does not have and the 5.5 inch screen was m deal breaker. Only Samsung can have me competing against itself.

review_title: Will be better as apps are developed
review_text: I bought this phone after owning a Samsung Galaxy S, T-Mobile Vibrant. It didn't take me long to become a fan of Samsung phones and this phone is certainly not a disappointment. It didn't come with a SDHC card as the Vibrant did and I think for the price it should have. The display is beautiful and all features work well on the phone itself. The size isn't an issue for me as I generally use a bluetooth device for phone calls. The stylus is readily available and works well with the S-Note function. I'm still exploring the phone but the one issue I have may not even be related to the device itself: I can't play my favorite football game as the app isn't supported on the phone. Thanks Samsung for a great product!

review_title: Who needs a tablet? Fast and powerful, fun to use
review_text: I love this phone. There are tons of features, too many to mention. I recommend that you handle this phone personally before buying, it may be too big for some. If the Note II feels good, then get it. It is fast, no laggy programs. The screen is beautiful and bright. The S Pen works as advertised. The sound quality of calls is good. One thing I find annoying is the Touch Wiz skin over Jellybean. It looks alright, but there are just too many extras for which tutorials always seem to appear.

review_title: Intimidating at first
review_text: Wow, this is quite a machine. Being my first "Smart" phone, I have found it a little intimidating at first. But I've jumped right in making silly mistakes that do no harm. I've had the phone for less then a week, so I am not an expert at drilling down through the various systems to get the displays to look how I want, but I'm making progress. I am a tall person with large hands so I appreciate the width of the phone, not that I believe this will be a problem with average size people. My wife got the same phone, she is not tall, and finds the phone fits nicely in her hands. The few apps I've downloaded work well. No slow down as the CPU works. Watch a video from NASA TV and it streamed smoothly. Have no idea how games run, but I probably won't find out since I'm not interested in them. My only problem is getting use to typing on the screen. Swype makes more errors then I care for, so I spend too much time editing. I've ended up using my pinky to type because the ends of my other fingers are too large. Since I'm a touch typist, using my pinky to reach the keys is weird. The screen is beauty. Had read some people thought the screen to too dim, but I haven't found that to be the case for how I use it. Voice commands are not working well since the machine hasn't adjusted to my voice yet. Battery holds up well for all the processing the CPU is doing. So much more to learn. Quantum leap from my old flip phone. My iPhone friends have been impressed.

review_title: I absolutely love this phone!!!
review_text: The Galaxy S3 was a big upgrade for me. I went from a Blackberry that I thought I loved until the S3. I am still learning how to use everything but it is very user friendly. I am so happy I did the upgrade and got the Samsung Galaxy S3. I wanted this phone the first time I heard about it.

review_title: Finally Satisfied
review_text: I have had every possible phone you could think of, in pursuit of finding the 'perfect' phone that would meet all of my needs. I can 100% say that I have finally found that phone. I am so happy with this phone I don't see the need to look anywhere else. It's so crisp and clean. The software is amazing. Along with stunning graphics. It really does learn how you are and reacts to your every action. I don't have one dislike about this phone. If you are a hard to please tech geek like myself and are tired of breaking your bank trying to keep up with the latest and greatest....go buy this phone NOW and settle down for a while. You WON'T regret it. GOOD JOB SAMSUNG!!!!

review_title: Outstanding
review_text: I do not know why people complain about the SIII dropping calls cause mine doesn't. All of my apps work great on it. The cameras are outstanding, the speaker is outstanding, the screen is outstanding, the whole layout of the SIII is outstanding, etc. I love all the smart features that they added on to the phone with S voice, the smart motions, and all of the voice recognition features. I haven't had the chance to try S beam or the TecTiles but hope to do so soon.

review_title: It Excels in any Smartphone Out on the Market. Everyone is still waiting on the Android 4.2.1 update with multitasking!
review_text: Compared to other smartphones, the Galaxy S3 makes it super easy to share using Sbeam or all Shareplay. It gives you much more freedom than the Iphone 5. It allows you to surf the internet and download/use files that the Iphone can't even open. It can play online videos using flash or any other player. The android market is free and is expanding very quickly. I have recorded video from the Galaxy S3's camera, and it comes out in crystal clear high definition with great sound, and people think I recorded the video on a HD video-camera. The phone is super light weight and fits in your pocket. The people that say its too big, are too dumb to realize how small their phones are. Once you use the Samsung Galaxy S3's screen all Iphones will look incredibly tiny. This is the #1 smartphone of 2012 for a reason, and in countries like China and the UK, it is the most sold smartphone. This phone is now an important part of my life, and it helps me to complete lots of tasks! Worth buying!

review_title: Great phone
review_text: This is a great phone! Crystal clear screen, takes great pictures even in low light. Very light weight. The screen is bigger than the IPod touch so viewing movings on the go is great! Battery life is not bad I usually have to recharge every 2 days or so depending on how much usage. This phone was well worth the price. I've had the phone for 2 months, and I could not be more pleased with the performance, features, and design. Have already recommended to friends.

review_text: I love the phone, i have no cons except for Samsung Firmware update. It takes us a while to get an update. i dont understand why US is always the last to receive the update. is it because of the share market? come on... i've been using Samsung since Galaxy S and i still keep waiting for an update....... They keep saying next month and its october now and we supposed to have this month. I really dont want to root my phone and install another rom because i love what you have but it makes me do it because you are to slow.

review_text: This phone beats the iphone 5 and other top android in many ways. Battery life is better than most android phones out there, the built quality is amazing. The camera is top notch, the best. Samsung also has added a lot of really cool features to the operating system that will make your life easier including on-call equalizers, quick-text reply why you have an incoming call and much more. In addition the sensor features are awesome. What can I say, I have recommended this phone to over 30 people since I have it. The screen size is perfect.

review_title: The Galaxy S 5 keeps my life organized and helps me perform my daily tasks efficiently!
review_text: The phone is a wonderful tool to help one keep track of the task-oriented and deadline driven world we live in today. It offers a wide variety of features which can all be personalized to your specific tastes. I love how it can capture the most picturesque photos while also having the ability to expand the storage capacity to a staggering 60+ gigabytes! I heavily rely on this phone and its smooth operation and transition from app to app. The processor speed is phenomenal! There are so many functions that gear themselves to the user. It really does give you a feeling of actually owning the phone because you have the capability of making changes that no other brand of phone on the market can offer. The SGS5 is the best phone I have ever owned and I recommend it to anyone in the market for an individualized phone!

review_title: The Next Big Thing
review_text: I pre-ordered my Galaxy S5 and received it on April 9th. So for my experience with it has been astonishing. I had my doubts at the reveal as many others had, but I must say it is a big step from the Galaxy S4 in many ways. While this is not the new revolutionary phone we all hyped it to be, it is still a very solid phone all around. Why should you upgrade from the S4? That depends on you. Although the S5 is only a step from the S4, it's still a large step at that. The performance is better, the camera is better, the display is better. That is what most people look for in today's phones. The design also feels more premium, however many will not be able to tell the difference from the S4 by looking at it from the front or with a case on. One major feature that may lead you to buying this phone is it is water resistant. It may not stay submerged for too deep or too long, but it will survive most cases. There are videos that show it surviving submerged in water up to an hour with no issues. Back to the point, it's worth upgrading for most, but if you're tight on cash or feel it's not good enough for you, you might wanna wait for the Next Next Big Thing. What's so great about the Camera? 16MP allows you to film with 4K video, which looks stunning on big displays. It also has a super slow motion mode, HDR(tone) which makes the dark balance out, Selective Focus, and many other features. This phone allows you to take photos that can match professional cameras. Many people were skeptical about the dot design on the back. The back has a good grip and premium feel to it, much better than the S4's flimsy plastic design. The Heart Rate monitor is pretty accurate. I don't really find an actual use for it other than it's fun, but some might find it useful for checking their progress of getting fit. (Lower the heart rate, the better). The finger print scanner for me is an actual disappointment. I can hardly get it to accept my finger print, I managed to get my index finger registered, but Its not consistent enough to use as a lock screen or a pay with PayPal feature. You have to swipe down in a straight motion, otherwise it does not work. Maybe it's just me, but compared to the iPhone 5S's finger scanner, this is just a gimmicky feature. One thing to note, is that in the US, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile do not allow the feature "Download Booster" to be used. This was something I was looking forward to but found it absent from my phone's settings. Everything else about the phone is solid. I haven't had any connection issues with AT&amp;T. 4G LTE is very fast. The quad core 2.5ghz processor is great. Drop tests show that the phone can handle quite a lot without a case. Camera takes great pictures and video. Overall this is a great phone and I recommend to anyone who is looking to get a new phone.

review_title: High Tech product
review_text: I am very happy satisfied that i made a right decision by choosing samsung galaxy 5 with android software after using apple products for years Great performance with bigger screen. Apple wont be getting my business again for iphones. Bye bye to apple from my life No lags at all. Battery performance is very good and its way better than apple phones Android have too many apps and more better than ios. and this s5 phone is perfect in every way for daily normal user to heavy users and it high def screen looks very beautiful and stunning while playing a game or watching movie and offer too many customizable user setting on the phone which i never receive it in the apple phone e.. i seen many reviews in writing and videos on you tube regarding the plastic back cover and that it does gives cheap look to a phone. TO me its the best thing i have seen in all smart phones. very light weight and its gives extra grip to the user to hold the phone... Its very soft and its very much resistible to scratches.. Great piece of engineering behind plastic cover as well. )

review_title: Outstanding, Fantastic and All Around Greatness
review_text: If this isn't the best phone in the market right now, I don't know what is. This phone is superb. The screen is flawless. The battery life will get you through a day with moderate usage with 50% remaining after 16 hours of use (3,200 mwh). The CPU will handle most of your commands without a hiccup. This has 3GB of RAM. 32GB on standard model (about 25GB usable after installing all your apps) will be enough for most of your files. The S pen is a great tool for most (if not all) professionals. On the other hand, Samsung still has room to improve it's products. The DAC (digitial to analog chip) could be better, so don't expect your music to sound audiophile quality. The phone still feels like a toy because of the plastics used, same thing with the S pen. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the best phone in the market right now. It has everything you need to replace at least your other phone or your small tablet. However, you should get a decent case and perhaps a replacement S-pen just in case you drop your phone or lose your S-pen.

review_title: I LOVE IT!
review_text: I just upgraded to the Note 3 from the SG3. I admit I was on the fence and almost uped to the GS4. But wow. I am glad I went with the Note 3. This phone has so many features I expect to spend at least the next month or so just figuring everything out. So far, the battery life is simply incredible. When I purchased the phone it was fully charged. I've been playing with it ever since I got it syncing, allshare stuff, pictures, tons and tons of calls, texts, videos and this thing is only at 48%. I've had it for a couple of days. Also purchased a tablet the Note 8.0 they compliment each other perfectly. that will be a different review. I have been a Samsung customer for about 6 yrs now but it's mainly been home entertainment. I am now a Samsung addict! I highly recommend this phone. If you're on the fence between this and the SG4, get the Note 3. For all you'll get, its a deal when you compare the prices. I'll do another review once I've gotten to know it better. Not bad Samsung

review_title: Bigger is Better !
review_text: I jumped from an excellent Galaxy S 3 on the Note 3 after my girlfriend purchased it. There are huge overall improvements in all areas of the phone over the Note 2 which i played with occasionally. Touch wiz is better for couple of notches and I'm yet to fall in love with the S pen features which I rarely use. Still some confusion with the layers of touch wiz and android but this is a Power User Phone and since you bought this phone You know your way around android! Performance is on par with a home desktop PC and it destroys everything you throw at it ! Gorgeous screen,light weight with a look of an art peace in your hand intuitive and packed with tons of useful features what more can I say ?!?

The size was a con at first, but I've found that the large display comes in handy while trying to write notes, watch videos, and blog from my phone. Samsung also has the option for Easy Mode, which helps you transition to an advanced smartphone. I love how I can customize this phone and truly make it my own. This device is a must have.

review_title: Galaxy Note 3 - Better than a Smartphone
review_text: I have had my Note 3 for about a month and love it. I was concerned about the size at first, but got used to it very quickly. The larger screen is great for typing, web content and gaming. I answer more email on it off hours than I do on my laptop now. I like the S-Pen also - excellent for marking up screnshots or photos (maps) and sending them to friends, also good for notebook applications like Evernote and One Note. I like the Air Command Also, but to be honest, don't find myself using it as much as I thought. Tied in with the Android OS and updated Google Now this is quite a device. Hope to see an update to TouchWiz soon, the new screenshots from CES 2014 look great. I like that I can send local video to my Samsung TV as well, and screen share with my Samsung Tablet.

review_title: Great Windows Phone for Sprint
review_text: This phone looks and feels great. It's light but durable, and the screen is bright and clear. The Windows Phone 8 OS flies on this hardware. Everything I do is lightning quick and I can customize whatever I want on my live tiles screen. Added bonus is that it has a removable battery and SD card slot, which is something every phone should have these days. So far, the battery life is really good for a smart phone - it lasted me around 2 days with moderate web use. My only major con to the device would be that it looks pretty much the same as every other Samsung phone. I made the jump to Windows Phone with this device and have not regretted it!

review_title: Another great installment in the successful Galaxy Phone family
review_text: The Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus are the two best Android devices I've owned. I've also owned a Samsung Epic 4G, which was my first Android/Samsung Phone, and that was an incredibly smooth experience as well. The screens are always the best on the market, the audio is usually great too. The build quality is definitely good, and although a bit too plastic at times, it is always sturdy *and* light(which couldn't be achieved with bulky parts). I would always recommend Samsung devices to anyone, however-if you prefer a heavy-duty, rough-resistant device, Samsung *may* not be for you. I've dropped my devices and they have never, *ever* broken. To me, they are lightweight, thin, and of very high quality, so I will always buy Samsung smartphones.

It has nearly every feature of the Iphone 5, in a more practical pakage.

review_title: Samsung's Galaxy Nexus Smartphone ROCKS!
review_text: As both a technology expert (B.S.in Engineering Technology) and a Sprint customer since 2008, I was looking forward to upgrading my phone to one of two Samsung units. When Sprint offered early upgrade eligibility AND an exceptionally affordable Galaxy Nexus Smartphone, I was ecstatic. The Galaxy Nexus is an incredible device. Right out of the box, activating the phone was a snap, and using it could not have been simpler. Like the Samsung Tab 2 7.0 (WiFi) I purchased the same week, discovering the full range of features and capabilities is akin to finding new treasure each time you go exploring. Fundamentally, the Galaxy Nexus Smartphone looks sleek, feels right, and performs like a NASCAR champion. Living in rural areas of Texas, I have relied solely on cellular phone and mobile data services since 1992, using dozens of the best wireless devices available. The Galaxy Nexus is unquestionably my favorite mobile phone ever.

review_text: The only complaint I have so far is the location of the power and volume buttons (they are easy to bump when you don't want to). Other than that I love this phone! It was a great upgrade from the Samsung Vibrant (3G). I will continue purchasing and recommending Samsung phones as long as they keep it up!

review_title: A reliable companion
review_text: I purchased the GS3 in July 2012 and have never stopped loving it. Even after a year, I'm still learning new things I can do with it. I use my phone to read books, listen to music, take photos, surf the internet, play games, and watch Netflix. It's always fast and responsive. The internet browser is so simple to use and I love the fact I can open up multiple browsers and easily switch back and forth between them. With the most recent software upgrade came the ability of having two applications open at once via a split-screen. I also appreciate that while watching Netflix or YouTube, I can make the screen a pop-out image so I can continue to watch while I respond to emails or texts. There is nothing I don't like about this phone.

review_title: My First Great Smartphone
review_text: This is an all around decent phone. Great Price, Great Camera, Great Screen. I like the way the apps are easily loaded, Some apps use too much processor and is slow when a few apps are left running. Background processes load again and again even though you turn them off. Overall I give this phone a 8.5 out of 10. I need this phone to help me organize my life style and that I can trust. Easy navigation, screen size, tuff, durable and good quality picture and video

review_text: This phone it's just amazing even though I did a lot of research before deciding between GS3 and Note 2 it exceeded my expectations by far. Only thing I need to get use to is the power button since my last evo 4g had it on top this one is on the side and I keep pressing volume buttons when trying to put it to sleep but is not a big deal, battery takes a little too long to charge. Dictation text works just awesome in English and I use it a lot in Spanish too and I never thought it would be so accurate with very little mistakes in Spanish.

review_title: Fabulous Phablet!
review_text: i have been a huge fan of the galaxy series in general and of course the galaxy note 2 did not dissapoint! Some might say its too big of a phone but i say just the opposite! If you are going to watch movies, play games, stream shows why would you ever want to do that on a tiny, low pixel screen?! Also, with the Allshare hub, I am able to transform my phone to share all my media right to my big screen (Samsung, of course) TV! I am so impressed with Samsung and this phone! I have had them all, the Galaxy SII, SIII, and now the Galaxy Note II...I cant wait to see what Samsung will come up with next!

review_title: Not a smartphone, but a "genius" phone!
review_text: This is much more of a "personal productivity appliance" than a cell phone! Samsung has taken the class to a whole new level! The phone and its calling features are excellent, but combined with the S-Pen, the new OS, the tremendous number of available apps, this Note 2 is absolutely tremendous. The great challenge for the owner is to master all the fantastic features available! I am thrilled I was the first on line at our local Sprint corporate store to get my Note 2.

review_title: Great phone, drops calls all the time though.
review_text: Overall, the design and performance of the phone is amazing. The screen is crisp and bright, it is powerful enough to handle any task thrown at it and the battery life is great. The only issue I have is the service. I've read online that Samsung has some of the worst radios in their phones and now I'm a believer. I rarely get service inside of buildings and the phone drops calls constantly.

review_title: Fantastic phone, probably the best out there.
review_text: Honestly this phone is near perfect. It's very fast, has some great software optimizations built in, and is designed very chic. I love that its battery is class leading and the screen seems to not steal away too much power. Because the phone is near perfect, assume I have only great things to say, and here are the only negatives I can think of, if they even are. The S-pen is cool, but I seldom use it. The screen is a little sensitive, causing me to make some typos if i'm not careful. The pentile arrangement they chose over saturates the blues a little more than other galaxy devices. The sprint versionI have, has the ports for wireless charging covered. The hdmi dongle and allshare media hub don't work as seamlessly as I'd like. Wireless Optimization app (system app) turns on or off some radios as it chooses, I don't like this because when I turn WIFI off, it should stay off, same with NFC. The screen is 1280x720 while other flagships are 1920x1080.

review_title: Great Android Intro Phone
review_text: I chose this phone based on the value with price. Another big influence was the physical QWERTy board on the device which I find preferable on a phone. Out of the box it functions well and I haven't had any issues after owning and using it for a week. The QWERTy board has good feedback and is very useful when I prefer not to use the built-in touch screen. The Android version 2.3.6 OS runs well although I have found some good applications that will not run with this OS. Although it is understandable considering that the hardware / firmware will not operate certain applications. Overall it is a great and useful phone; one I hope to use for awhile. I really anticipate that Samsung continues this line of phones because they really are a decent product.

review_title: Connectivity Issues
review_text: For the past couple of weeks I have been having connectivity issues. The phone won't even connect to LTE when it does it gets stuck on 3G or there is not a signal at all. I've googled this issue and have seen other complaints as well. This issue has nothing to do with the router because I don't have signal period. I am disappointed because I was so in love with my Samsung S4 and now I'm not. I couldn't make any calls at all yesterday. If I do find out that this is a Verizon issue and not Samsung I will change my rating. Even though I have had Verizon do some troubleshooting with the phone. Nothing seems to work.

review_title: Amazing Phone
review_text: I did my homework with this phone. For months I looked at this phone and compared it to other top end phones. After a lot of research I decided this was the best phone for the price I wanted to pay ( Note II is a better phone, but too much money) After getting it, I have been really impressed with it. I have had the phone for a week and each day I learn a new feature about it. I have showed my phone off and everybody has been really impressed with it. I look forward to learning more about this Amazing phone

review_title: Love the Galaxy S3 but not Sprint
review_text: This phone is exactly what I was hoping for. I love the size, it is easy to navigate, and I will be able to use it to take notes when meeting with clients. Thing is, I am unable to get more that 2 bars, occasionally 3, in Eureka, CA. The connection with the Sprint network is so poor that I may have to return the phone. This seriously disappoints me.
