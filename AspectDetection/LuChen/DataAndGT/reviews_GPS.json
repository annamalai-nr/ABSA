        "review_text": "I already own the Garmin i5, but decided to buy the 2720 because I wanted to be able to preconfigure my routes with the included mapping software. It is much easier to do so with the mapping software than with the unit itself.The 2720 is very powerful and configurable, but I give it 4 stars because it is:- Bulky, heavy and cumbersome to set up. The i5 that I own is much faster to set up, lighter and more compact. I prefer to use the i5 on short local trips and 2720 for longer routes since I can pre-configure my routes.- The usable area on 2720 screen is not very big. The newer models like Nuvi, c550 have bigger screens.- It seems to be very picky when entering street names. Even when I spell the name correctly, the 2720 sometimes still cannot find it. The i5 software is smarter and usually does not have trouble finding street names.- Uploading routes/via points from PC is extremely slow. The mapping software doesn't upload incremental changes. So if you add a couple of way points, it'll still upload everything you've ever entered.On the plus side:- The full version of the mapping software has more detail than the Lite version that came with i5. For example, the full version has the little roads in a cemetary that I visit annually, but the lite version doesn't.- I don't need to enter an address to go to a particular location. The only requirement is that the location needs to be on a road. So it can't be in the middle of a field with no roads. To do this I simply pick a spot on the street and just tell the 2720 to take me there. The i5 needs an address, but I can get around it by using intersections (not as good though).",

        "review_text": "I have owned this Garmin GPS for about 3 months and it has really helped out alot. I really hate maps and I'm not the most experienced driver, but with the Garmin c530 I am driving like a pro. It's very comforting knowing that I can find my way to a long distant job interview or navigate on busy highways.However, the c530 isn't perfect. The biggest problem (as other reviewers have pointed out) is that this unit doesn't announce street names. Second I have experienced a few glitches. There have been a few times when the unit tells you to turn at the wrong address. Sometimes the unit gets really wacky and the voice says turn right and the screen shows to turn left. Another time I used the \"point of intrest\" feature to get some food and the GPS took me to a residential home address. I have also noticed that the recalculating feature lags sometimes for a few minutes (leaving you without any directions). It's almost like it decides to take a nap.I don't regret buying this model, but I would rather own something that I know I don't need to upgrade. This one does the job, but it's almost embaressing sometimes when it screws up.I have to give it a bit of credit. It does seem to hold up in the city and sometimes through tunnels. However, if you get stuck in a traffic jam in a big tunnel in the city, this unit will crap out and lose the signal. I also like how the unit estimates your arrival time. If you go the speed limit, the time estimate is pretty acurate.",

After a 2 second argument she starts pushing buttons, and has it ready to go by the end of the driveway. It couldn't be easier. First question...State? You start to type New J, and buy the time you reach for the e New Jersey is on the screen. Same thing for city and street address. It's so easy to use that I never read the manual. There are many features(screens) that I didn't even know it had. Like touch the screen in the middle and you can drag the map around to look at other places (plus you can zoom in). Satilite position and strenght(not useful but cool). Find food on the road...fast food, Asian, Mex...My only complant... would be nicer with a larger screen... but that's more of a cash flow problem of mine, not the Nuvi.

        "review_text": "The 550 is as good if not better than my factory installed car GPS. Havng the buttons on the left is very handy. Though it's not recommended to use them when moving, I have found myself adjusting the volume of the MP3 player from time to time. Thus I mention that they could have made that task a bit easier, but that's a very minor detail.I do wish they made a sun shade for the 550. I did find one that \"sort of works\" online. But when it is in place it is a bit tough to operate those left hand buttons. Again, a minor point.The case that comes with the 550 is a very nice case, but it lacks a belt loop. So you either have to carry it in your hand, or put into a carry-all bag if you happen to have one. Now this is a pain in the butt.Now here's my biggest complaint. To use the full range of options (i.e. the XM Radio, and the Traffic / weather) you must purchase a antenna that sells for any where between $250 down to $190. That is the cheapest I've seen it online. So, you buy the 550 for the nice round number of $1,000 you still have to add the price of the antenna. Plus if you want the radio, weather and traffic you have to add the monthly charge for those services. The monthly charges I wouldn't mind so much, but I do not understand why this antenna costs more than about $35 or $40. I only think that is a rip off. But all in all, you will enjoy the 550.",

Finally the only way I could turn the unit on or off was by plugging in the power cord. Looked up the problem on the web and found that lots of other owners had the same problems and followed the instructions for replacing the on/off switch, not a job for the casual user but it worked. I was thrilled.Then the speaker died which makes the device much less useful since it is dangerous to try to read a small screen for directions while navigating through heavy traffic. After that I started to get warnings that I should update my maps which would cost me $100.At that point I gave up and bought a Tom Tom GPS in hopes of smoother sailing.Easy John",

The unit performs exceptionally well, and is very easy to use and understand.I use it on my BMW R1200GS and also in my car. The unit ships with all the stuff you need to mount it on the bike and in the car. There are maps available from Mad Maps which feature some nice motorcycle routes in a variety of different US states.I am a Mac user as well, and the only complaint I have so far with Garmin is that they don't seem to offer as much support for mapping software on a Mac as they do on a PC.

Finally, in total frustration, I called the company from whom I had bought the extended waranty. They told me to call Amazon.

I read some previous reviews and was a little disappointed in some of the shortcomings of the unit. I don't know if Garmin actually addressed the shortcomings of if the reviewer just didn't know how to access the feature. Two examples; one reviewer said that you couldn't \"MARK\" a location. This is easily done by simply touching the vehicle icon. You can then rename the location and save it to your favorites. Another reviewer talked about the lack of a compass option unless you are in the \"off road\" mode. If you are not navigating, there is a letter indicator on screen constantly and by one touch, you have access to a graphic compass. You always have access to the graphic compass page while navigating with one touch.I am very satisfied with the ZUMO 550 and would recommend it. One thing I would have liked is the option of getting AM-FM radio instead of XM. I have cable TV, but I still have a problem with paying for radio.I love gadgets, and I don't consider myself a \"techy\", but I rate the ZUMO 550 with a \"10\".",

        "review_text": "\"You did so well. I was wondering why I had not heard from you. I have drivers that have been here for years who still call me for directions. No wonder you did not call me even one.\" The owner heard that conversation and decided to make the GPS available for all of his drivers.The benefit of this unit over other GPS systems is that when it tells you to make a turn, it also tells you the name of the street that you are turning on to. Many GPS systems will say something like \"Turn Right at two hundred feet\". This is how the GPS that the owner of the limo company talks to him. He said it was difficult, because he would begin his turn only to find out it was the next turn that he needed to make, which made his driving somewhat dangerous.The only drawback that I have found with this unit is that when in San Diego the satellite info came in just a little slower than driving speed, so you often waited for it to catch up. However, in my Florida location... it works like a dream and has never let me down. I don't use the map book or google maps to get to where I need to go anymore.My Garmin Slogan is\" \"Don't Leave Home Without It!\"",

The unit still functions well. Only two negatives I can mention is the motorcycle mount is not completely waterproof. If rain gets down in the pins you lose XM Radio functionality until the mount drys out. A hard rain storm is enough to get the mount wet. On numerous trips I have had the mount get water in it and XM stops functioning for the rest of the trip. Second the lack of a qwerty keyboard is pretty annoying. These two minor annoyances really are minor. Overall the unit is well designed and functions extremely well for its intended purpose. I really believe Garmin had riders design this unit or they certainly got a lot of feedback from us.",

Blue tooth is great with my Cardon headset. MP3 and Blue tooth cell phone come in loud and clear. I am hard of hearing so I know. Motorcycle mount was easy to in stall. The wiring was the hard part. For the car mount, I went to Walmart an bought, a GPS pad that the suction cup will work with. I set it on the console in my car. This is great , because you can move it from car to car if you have more than one. It plugs into the liter socket for power. I have not had any problems with it, in the two years that I have had it. BBest of all for you is that you can get it for a lot less tnen I paid. I paid $800.00 for mine. It is still a bit pricey, but it is well worth it. I do not think you would be sorry if you bought it. A friend of mine asked me to order this one for her. She gave it to her boy fried for Christmas. I tell all my friends how well it works.

        "review_text": "Let me preface this by saying that I have used this unit--my third, one died and was replaced and the second fell and I had to have it repaired--they sent a refurbished unit-- I have had this unit for three years and ridden with it for 45k miles. Suffice it to say I have driven it around the block. I am very tempted to give it one star.What it does do is tell you where you are. The screens are nice and as long as you are just watching the screen change with you, it is fine.But get into a situation where you must interact with this unit and forget about using it while riding.Examples:No QWERTY keyboard. Instead they have some very hard to use scroll in one screen (see Amazon image) and in another there is an ABCDEF screen. BOTH of these screens could have just as easily been QWERTY. You cannot imagine how hard it is to use while riding, and it ain't no piece of cake when stopped. It is a real pita to use.Also, the menu items are so user hostile. If you are riding and you want to find fuel these are the stepsMenu...food/lodging...fuel...all types--4 steps to find a damn gass station. Finding a motel is even worse:Menu...food/lodging...arrow down...lodging...hotel/motel--5 steps to get there. They have the \"options\" in alphabetic order so you have to bypass ATM and ENTERTAINMENT to get to lodging and then you have to choose MOtelAnd once you do get there-gas food motel--then you have to understand the shorthand, look to see where the arrow points. And the arrows do not just point up the road or behind you, no, they point in compass directions so they may point toward 4 oclock or 9 oclock. And that may or may not be on your route. To see if it is on your route you must highlight it, and then press show map and see if it is relevant to your ride.The menus are totally fixed and cannot be user modified. I asked on the zumoforums about this and many people chimed in to also complain about this unit's user hostility and the mod smugly answered that that's \"just the way they are.\"I have no experience with any other GPS, but I have to believe that others have a better, much better, human interface. And it's real expensive also for these \"features.\" I would NOT recommend this unit, and I have one that doesn't spontaneously die.I bought this unit because Garmin tells us it is desgned by bikers for bikers. That is impossible to believe. It is just marketing hype. The more I use this device the more I find fault with it and I am not mentioning how directions can be screwed up, or if you decide to change your route on the fly the unit with continue to route you back to the part of the route you intentionally skipped until you stop it (Menu...stop) and restart your route (Menu...routes...select your route...go...no).Zumo, get a clue. And the most infuriating part? I'll bet a firmware fix would change all this, but nooooooo",

She is so user friendly a 7 year old could work her. She is extremely precise and accurate. Sometimes I question the route she is sending me on, but I have faith and she delivers. Just do what she says and you will be where you need to be when she says you will be there. I have NO negatives to report. She is easy to use, easy to understand, recomputes a perfect new route when you stray from her original suggestion and never misses a beat. I bought a travel case for her and I love that too. DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT HER!! My husband is in outside sales and has to go from one account to another and he just punches in the next address and she gets him right there. No more maps or asking directions. And she is very accurate when it comes to what time you will arrive. We are never late anymore either because of Jill.

Really loved being able to throw out all the maps in the car.On the negative side - Magellan went cheap on the map data. There are very good map databases out there, complete and frequently updated. This is not one of them. It tries to route me through streets that were dead-ended years ago.But my real issue is with the Points of Interest. Businesses come and go over the years. Magellan doesn't seem to really care. And the custom POIs that are supposedly available online? Traffic cameras, school zones etc are very well mapped IN EUROPE. I've found no downloadable data sets for the US besides zip codes.Routing is quirky. It rarely sends me out and back on the same streets. It always tries to get me onto a major highway as soon as possible. This results in me going to a destination on one highway, then on minor streets. On the return trip it puts me on a different highway, then on minor streets. Neither of which were the fastest route. Minor streets straight through would have been much quicker.The ability to create detours is very strange. You select a rectangular area encompassing multiple roads, rather than picking sections of a road.",

I traveled 1900 total miles on this trip and the Zumo 550 became an invaluable tool! I used it in the mountains of North Carolina always expecting the unit to Not know where I was or loose satilites but that Never happened. The built in blooth tooth linked my cell phone and bluetooth headset and I was able to hear directions clearly! With the extra mount for my car, I am able to quickly move the unit from bike to car effortlessly. I look forward to adding the XM antenna to an already feature packed unit. I loaded my 2GB SD card and listened to my favorite music and also loaded pictures of the trip on the unit as well. Don't bother looking at any other units for your motorcycle, THIS IS IT!!\"As for you folks upset about having to use a headset to hear the directions, how were you expecting to hear anything from a speaker on a GPS at highway speeds?

We have taken two small trips with it already without plans, finding restaurants and hotels with the unit. If I were to make any improvements at all, it would have a battery and it would also have the ability to do long distance searches for points of interest, etc. These two items alone should not be enough to deter you from purchasing it.... I have done a lot of research and read numerous reviews on other units, and I wouldn't trade for any other unit in this price range. A \"big\" plus for this unit is the size of the screen. It is large enough to sit on the dash with clear instructions, even without the voice option turned on.Since I purchased mine, I decided to treat my dad to one as well... Needless to say he's been like a kid in a candy store ever since!I give this unit 4 out of 5 stars... It's a keeper!!!",

The user-interface of Mercedes unit is horrible and the graphics output is very plain.The only drawback when compared to factory-built car GPS is that the portable unit doesn't work well in tunnel as it relies on satellite signal where built-in ones use other sensor in the car as well.In my opinion, if you don't really need other features like bluetooth, wider screen, and other features I consider gimmicks, Nuvi 350 is perfect for such this price, as it is solid for one thing, navigation.",

I would be very careful buying this product if it is on sale - Make sure the latest updated maps are on the system. Otherwise it is pretty easy to use. I like the preloaded information that helps you look for resturants and other attractions. Very useful but also very much out of date. The versionof Maps on my unit is at least 2 years old.

I have had it almost a year now and there is no doubt that I made the right call on this one.- It is by far the easiest to use - practically intuitive.- It is so small it fits in a pocket or purse which is great if you valet park or park in high theft areas.- Also great if you are visiting a city because you can carry it with you and use it to locate restaraunt, theaters, landmarks, ect.- Voice directions are very helpful so you can watch road and not have to look at GPS.- It is not confused by jughandle turns, access roads or service roads like many GPS's are.On the downside:- No bluetooth phone.(available on newer Nuvi models)- Offers only one route at a time (shortest, fastest, ect.) others offer three routes at once and you choose.",

        "review_text": "Best human interface of any electronic device I've ever owned or seen. Far superior to the built-in unit in my fancy Mercedes. The \"heads-up\" style display (perspective view) is easy to read at a glance. It is bright and clear under all conditions except when sun is shining directly on it... note however that wearing polarized sunglasses diminishes the brightness significantly. The touch screen menu is clear, simple, and user friendly. It takes you to exact street numbers, not to a range. It shows you names of cross streets as you approach. Window mount is well designed and secure. You can buy an extra window mount for ease in cross-decking the unit between vehicles. It knows which streets are one-way. It knows the restricted hours for our HOV commuter lanes in Washington DC area. It is not perfect, however. It occasionally picks a less-than-optimal route (but you still get there, and it recalculates when you know better and ignore an instruction). By all means plot a route with MapQuest also if you are planning a trip before you get into the car and go... no way a little hand-size unit like this will be as intelligent and up-to-date as MapQuest with its massive servers. The Nuvi's built in rechargeable lithium-ion battery is not user replaceable when it eventually dies. Before you can use the map that comes with the unit you have to establish an on-line account to activate it. Nuvi provides regular software updates for functions... not sure how often the maps are updated. Overall there are very few drawbacks. A great product.",

I emailed Garmin, and assumed that they'd send me the current version for free since I just bought this brand new unit. Nope.

I never thought it would come in handy so much in my daily life. The 350 offers so many options if you like music, or need to find out what is the closest store from you exact location, too viewing the whole United States and pin pointing the exact spot or location you need to go. It is a very handy tool if you know the just the name of a place or location and it will search its database and find the location with a phone number and address.

        "review_text": "I recieved the Garmin Nuvi as a Christmas present and so have been driving with it for about 6 months. I am basing this review off my experience with the Tomtom ONE, which my father owns. I found that the Garmin was so simple to use and made my life easy, especially when I wanted to find stores and didn't have internet access or any way to look up the nearest location of a store. With the Garmin was able to just spell the name and do a quick search; once I chose the store location, it navigated me right to the store- no problem. While the Tomtom ONE has a similar feature with the POI, I found it more difficult to search. The other thing I liked about the Garmin was the detour feature. I drive around DC and Long Island alot, due to my job and often, as one could imagine, I find myself stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. One simple step, and I was detoured off of the highway (or whatever road I may be on) and re-routed. Again, while this can be done on the Tomtom, I found if more difficult since there are added steps and screens one has to go through. After using my Garmin, my father has decided to trade-in his Tomtom for a Garmin of his own!I now find myself automatically turning my Garmin on whenenver I am in the car- even if I know where I am going. The design itself is extremely compact and holds alot of extra features, such as an MP3 Player and an audiobooks feature. Though it is a little pricey, I highly recommend this product (especially if you are new to the world of gps') to anyone",

If you hate trailing wires, the Garmin has several hours of battery life and can be recharged with any mini-USB charger, probably the same as your cellphone uses.

After the first trip her comment was I wouldn't have made it to my meeting on time without it. She had encountered heavy fog which obstructed her view of the street signs and could barely see the vehicle in front of her. The Garmin worked flawlessly guiding her to the destination when she couldn't see by giving her advance notice of upcoming turns. After the second trip her comment was I love it...She traveled to area where previously she had experienced problems in reaching her destination and returning home without getting lost or turned around...I would highly recommend this unit for anyone.

I sought after affordability, ease of use, and performance. This unit fits the bill perfectly.My wife is a \"team mom\", and she frequently drives to various gyms for games all over town. She also had a bad habit of driving with the phone to her ear (she refuses to wear an earpiece). Now she can receive calls hands free, and the screen clearly displays the incming caller ID. I had limited experience with GPS systems, so I was a bit nervous about what top expect. After our 1st use, I know I made a good choice. Afer \"playing\" with it for 10 minutes, the wifey handles her navigation like a pro. With a touch of the \"Where To\" menu she enters the address (if known) or she searches for it by name similar to a google search.Its interface is simple and intuitave - we've yet to read the directions. The display is bright and clear under all lighting situations we've encountered; your next move is displayed clearly on the screen; and the spoken directions are given at about the right time as a reminder. There are several voice options, (my wife prefers the Brit guy voice, I prefer the Aussie babe accent :-)As far as the navigation goes, I've observed that it \"links up\" in 3 seconds or less, and if you chose to stray off course, it recalculates within a second or 2.I'm sure there are many more features, but we were looking for the ability to get simple directions clearly displayed and spoken. Really, I'm amazed at how often she uses it and how we got by this long without it.Overall, you will have a hard time beating this model for something that works well.",

Then I used it to get to a destination 45 minutes away that I was pretty sure I knew how to get to, but just wanted to be sure and it worked beautifully.Like any good GPS it re-mapped my route as I detoured to get gas, and the voice instructions were really excellent providing plenty of time to change lanes on the high way for upcoming exits. I liked the large screen display, which is easy to follow (although I generally ignored it as the voice instructions were so good). It asked for when I needed to get to my appointment and navigated me the most direct route (given current gas prices this is critical).Why not 5 stars? I wish it had a plug in for when I'm home (comes with computer USB plug in and car charger), but I'm guessing I can buy one if I get really annoyed. Also, I wish the volume was louder, I had to keep the radio nearly off to hear the voice. I do recommend purchasing a separate mounting pad (like a non-skid bean bag) to ensure you don't have the tell-tale suction cup mark on your windshield, a sign to potential thieves to break into your car to look for your GPS unit.",

Really great for getting out of and back to often confusing big airport rental car lots. Only two minor complaints:--the screen is a bit washed out in bright sun. Not sure how to fix that but hopefully there is a solution to be found in future models.In cloudy weather or at night it is fine.--more important, the voice turn indicator comes much too late. Sometimes it is fine, e.g., \"Turn left on Main Street in 400 feet.\" More often, however, it will give you this instruction only when you are just crossing the street you should actually have turned on. When the screen is washed out from the sunlight, you need this voice instruction in advance! This is particularly annoying when you are on a three or four lane road and you know from the lower right corner screen instructions that you will be turning in, say, 400 feet, but you don't know whether to the right or the left.",

        "review_text": "Got this on Black Friday 2007 after having used Tom Tom and would have to advise against buying this. You need to download the Firmware update to get many of the earlier bugs fixed but make sure you do not attach to your PC before starting the update or you may have USB Hardware issues. Firmware update does allow you to see expected arrival time (by tapping on distance to go).My biggest hate though is the routing. I wanted to go from Alpharetta, GA to Panama City, FL. I've done this journey numerous times and it should take 5 1/4 hrs and about 320 miles. When I ask the unit to calculate the Fastest Route it takes me on a 500+ mile trip on I75/I10 and it says it will take 8+ hours. When I ask for the Shortest Distance, it more or less takes me the way I want to go (says the 320 mile I expected) but says it will take around 6 hours.....so how comes it won't pick this for the Fastest route. (For comparison Mapquest calculates my preferred route at 319.75 miles and 5 3/4 hrs). I found a similar issue with some local routes also....very odd and very annoying.I saw other comments about maps out of date. Mine just says version 27 (with no date) and the Magellan website says they expect to issue updates every 12 - 18 months although does not state what, if anything, they will cost (the firmware update is free btw)Its not a bad unit but I just know the Tom Tom is better and about the same price",

It has lots of features, many that I haven't had the time to try yet, such as a built in mp3 player and fm transmitter so you can hear directions from your car's stereo system. The really nice thing I like about this product is if you know a short-cut to where you are going, the device automatically recalculates the route, instead of constantly demanding you to turn around. In every case, it picked up on my short-cut! The map updates are free as well, and the unit will notify you automatically when there is a new version available.ConsI selected the free shipping and it took almost three weeks to arrive. I was hoping to have the device for a trip to Dallas, but it took so long to arrive, I had to take my trip without it.

I think the NUVI is worth the premium over the Street Pilot series as it is a much nicer and compact package. We are able to travel with it on the plane and walk on the streets without any difficulty. They all come with the Text-To-Speech which keeps me less dependant on viewing the screen. The screen size is more than adequet and the reciever is sensitive enough that we can keep it by the gear shift and it will still catch the satellite signal--something I have heard the tom-toms are not able to do. Suprisingly, my Garmin 350 is able to locate new bypasses that just opened after its manufacture date. The battery life is approx 7 hours by my estimate. My only major complaint is the quality of the voice can be better. Overall, the MUVI is high recommend..as it is very portable and now all our cars and family members can share it the security of a GPS device.",

        "review_text": "I took this GPS with me on separate trips to Baltimore, Boston, PA/Delaware. My sister has taken it to North Carolina. Overall, this is a very good GPS with such a low price tag.Pros:1. Fairly accurate directions for road trips (of course, if you use it in your hometown, it wouldn't be accurate since you know all the shortcuts)2. Small size, portable. In many cities where homeless and questionable people roam, it is very convenient to just shove the gps unit in the glove box. The screen is enough for looking at maps and directions.3. Easy to program, customize. If you browse around, you will find websites that shows you how to change the skins, add a media player, and change wallpaper. Or, you can just use it as a gps too.4. Voice prompt. It doesn't have text to speech, but it gives advance warning on how far you are to the next turn. Some people complain about the low volume, I have no problem with the volume. I also do not blast music.5. POI works very well. I used the POI feature extensively on my PA trip. I used it to locate bookstores, movie theaters, and hotel. I even used it to locate bestbuy in Delaware so I can purchase my laptop tax free. The POI locations were very useful and come in handy.6. Price. At $179.99, it's very affordable.Cons:1. Screen Freeze. I have not encountered this problem on all of my trips. But according to my sister, it froze on her while she was in North Carolina. She did a simply hard reset, and the unit was back on. I think the problem is probably she drop the unit a few time while she was driving.2. NOT for traveling in big cities. The gps gets confused when roads are close together. Satellite signals are easily lost in NYC due to high-rise buildings blocking signals.Overall, I like this gps very much. It was a great buy. I travel alot now that I don't have to constantly trying to figure out where I'm going.",

        "review_text": "Yes, it's true! This is a fantastic device. Just a couple of notes:1) The 350 I purchased in October 2006 came with the latest maps (v8). My understanding is that earlier this year the 350s came with v7 installed.2) The device can show the latitude, longitude and elevation (it's in the satelite view).3) The mp3 player sounds very good. I hooked it to my car's Bose system by using a plain old tape adapter and I'm very satisfied with it.4) The suction cup is perfectly glued to the windshield! It was pretty hard to remove it upon returning my rented car. I've no idea why some people complain about it - perhaps they don't know they have to create suction by using the small lever on the cup.5) This is a sophisticated device with a lot of functions. The user interface is truly outstanding though and it makes it very easy to navigate among all these options.6) The device comes with localized menus. I got quite a kick when I configured it to use menus in my native language (Romanian).7) The satellites are acquired fast, even indoors (in a wooden house, for example). Obviously though, don't expect to receive the satellite signal if you're under a concrete structure or under a metallic roof!8) The maps are excellent and with a lot of detail. It was very useful to see the upcoming road curves on the map while driving at night, at high speed, on a remote highway in Utah! However, don't expect the map to be 100% accurate - I found that a local highway from a rural Vermont area was missing.9) Unfortunately, this device doesn't have a USB 2.0 interface so it takes *forever* (2+ hours) to fill the 700M of available memory with mp3 files! I purchased a high speed 2GB SD card to store my music files.",

        "review_text": "I'm a fan of the Hertz Magellan Neverlost system, but the bi-modal reviews of the Magellan Systems gave the impression that there were prodcution quality issues.Next, I was going to go for the Garmin 2720. It can be fitted with dead reckoning, but needs wiring to the car. Reviews made me realise, my main reason for buying a GPS was not to use on my car, but on business trips and hence rental cars. So portability was key, and the Nuvi has the best form factor. To lug a 2720 (with laptop, files etc) on business trips would make things just the bit more heavy.In addition to the good points given by other reviewers, I must say the mount is excellent. It sticks well and because the Nuvi is so light, the mount does not have a lot to do to stick there. Also, the cigarette lighter power can cleverly be plugged straight into the mount and not the unit. To mount the Nuvi, you have only to flip the antennae up (activating the GPS) and clip it on. It powers up straight away. Then, when you get out, all you've to do, is press a small clasp release on the mount and out pops the Nuvi. It even switches itself off after 30 seconds.You can also put the Nuvi in \"search mode\". While driving on the free way looking for food or lodging, you only have to press \"where to\" and then press say \"lodging\". The Nuvi gives you an list of hotels, motels, hostels near you. It also provides distance and arrows showing whether they are ahead or behind your current position. The list updates itself every few minutes as you move along. See something you like? Just press it and the \"GO\" button and Nuvi takes you there. It was a life saver when we were travelling long distance late at night and needed somewhere convenient to stay.Finally, this is one gadget that my wife loves. When on holidays, she invariably ends up the navigator. Its stressful for her and things get heated up when I make a wrong turn requiring difficult new instructions on what to do. Nuvi has changed all that. She just sleeps through, as the Nuvi announces its \"recalculating\" the route.But indeed, you don\"t get a Map which you can load on your PC, there is apparently no way to plan/alter routes on the Nuvi prior to making a trip or to keep a record of your trips.Garmin has been excellent in addressing user feedback, so I am hopeful.BTW, I don't use the other functions such as MP3/calculator and would prefer the functionality on the GPS be improved rather than these functions. But that's just me since I still use a PDA.",

Once I was going to the airport (ATL), the usual way - hit a bad traffic jam, took the alternate route, hit two more traffic jams - pulled off the highway, drove a mile or two and fired up the NUVI. It found the airport on back roads - no signage - and I made the flight. Highly recommend and from what I've heard software much better than other companies. Note - the 200 series doesn't have turn by turn voice prompts - the NUVI does. If you're by yourself that's really worth it. Remember this cost $900 when it first came out so at $365 its a bargain.

The unit comes with a car power adapter and a windshield mount bracket - so I did not have to buy these separately. I really don't care about other bells and whistles, i.e. Bluetooth - so this unit is perfect for my needs. The unit does provide voice instructions. The only limitation is it does not tell the street name - but it really does not matter to me (I just turn left in 100 feet). It had one free map software download included. Unfortunately, I could only pick North America or Europe software, and not both. I chose the North America - since I would use it more (it took awhile to download even with fast internet connection). I highly recommend this product for a person that travels throughout North America and Europe and is on a budget.",

        "review_text": "I had problems with the 720 right out of the box. The included cd Home software needed to be upgraded and the download cut off the bottom half of the screen so you can't read the choices. Then the computer wouldn't recognize the 720 when plugged into the docking station. This took 4 hours of deleting software, redownloading updates etc. just to get the computer to recognize the 720. You have to go through this because you have to download software and map updates to get the 720 up and running. Now comes the real problem-the unit is inaccurate!!! The GPS is about 200-300 feet off!! It locates me in the middle of my neighbors driveway, and my home location is in the middle of woods on the west side of the neighbor, when I am actually on the east side. There was no way to get that corrected even with help of a very good tech support guy. Also when you go by an intersection the unit still shows you approaching it, again I would guess a lag of 200-300 feet in real time. We had a Garmin b-4 and it located you exactly, and was 50% more user friendly than the TomTom. The bottom line-buy the Garmin 360 and save yourself a lot of headache. That`s what I did today, the TomTom was returned!!! Tech support was very good but could not resolve issues.",

What I liked was the estimated time of arrival which adjusts to your speed, and it was accurate to within a minute. It gives you warnings before an intersection, and tells you when to make your turns. Easy to program and use.The only negative is the disc they give you for a permanent place to stick the device, the glue is worthless.

While the storage issue can be partially solved using SD cards, the passive mount is most likely in response to the mount issues that plagued the GO x10 series. This new design means that those who keep a mount permanently in their car will have to reconnect all cables each time they wish to utilize the device.",

I sent an online request with a copy of my receipt and after a couple of hours TomTom support sent me a response with a free copy of the most recent map.As far as user interface and routing go, TomTom and Garmin are generally regarded as the best by most GPS review sites. It seems to be a personal preference. There will inevitably be a route that one will prove better than the other, so you will have to live with that.The GO 720 also has the option to add an external antenna and install the unit in the dashboard console if you like.

        "review_text": "I've owned other Garmin vehicle GPS units and hands down they are the best brand you can buy. I personally wouldn't buy an in-dash GPS unit if it wasn't powered by Garmin.I did however find some disappointment in the c550. The feature I was most excited about was the bluetooth phone feature. To my disappointment, this feature doesn't really work all that great in all vehicles. My 2005 4runner has too much background noise when on a highway or interstate... virtually eliminating the use of the bluetooth. Those I call cannot understand what I'm saying. Maybe this feature works great in a high class luxury vehicle but not for me. It works better when I'm in slow traffice but I still feel I have to talk above my normal voice level for the other person to hear clearly.The mp3 player feature is also virtually useless. The music only plays out of the unit and the sound quality is poor. With the popularity of other mp3 players (ipod)... this feature is never used.The traffic fm receiver is cool but will only help you if you live in a big city. I live in a mid-size city and the traffic alerts are minimal. It might be very helpful in a larger city with more congestion. This feature is free for 90-days.The other features can be found in lower models like the c340. I'd almost prefer that I would have purchased that model over the more expensive c550.It all comes down to the features you want. If you need the traffic receiver and so-so bluetooth features... then this unit is for you. The navigation and quality of the product are what make this 4-stars. If you don't really need the added features... go with the c340. Same thing... minus the add-ons.",

        "review_text": "I picked up the c550 from another online retailer. It came in an OEM (plain white) box, but contained all pieces the standard-boxed unit comes with. Quick notes:- Acquires satellites much faster than my old Magellan RoadMate 700. Ready to go in less than a minute!- If used in 'map' mode, it shows the next road coming up. Would like to know if that road is on the left or right side, but that's just being picky I suppose.- 3D view is nice. Took some getting used to but I keep it in that mode now.- Battery life is outstanding.- The traffic feature is NOT INTEGRATED. It's part of the charger assembly. Had I known that, I may not have purchased this unit. When I read 'integrated' I expect it to be self-contained within the nav system.- Because the traffic feature isn't integrated, if you choose to go on battery power alone you lose the traffic feature. So part of the portability goes out the window, as far as I'm concerned.- Traffic monitoring is okay, but you have to have a route programmed in to get the feature, i.e., it won't give you traffic info on the road you're traveling on if you're in map mode.- I haven't tried the Bluetooth speakerphone yet, but will test it soon.- The POI feature is much nicer than some other systems I've tried. For example, if you query for restaurants, it will keep refreshing and updating your list, including distance and direction, while you move.- Estimated time of arrival nice to have.Overall, I'd buy this unit again. I picked over the c530 mainly for the Bluetooth functionality, but the traffic feature is nice as well. Too bad Garmin doesn't understand what 'integrated' means. I knocked off a star because of that.",

Have used it on a couple of trips and it has been excellent.Nice feature is that it has an antenna input, I used the antenna that came with my Garmin 40 GPS, this allows me to place the head unit lower in the car and still get excellent satellite coverage. I made a holder that allowed me to place it in one of the cup holders in my wife's 2002 MINI. Easy to use and out of the way. Had to seperate the suction cup portion of the mount from the cradle part that attaches to the head unit.This is the only negative, would like a cigarette lighter cord that plugs into the head unit without having to dismantle the suction cup mount. California and some other states have banned windshield suction cup mounts.Overall a great little product and I am very happy with it.",

I can usually find my way around in unfamiliar territory. That said, when traveling you often need to know what lane to be in before you turn, and even more important, in the NY or New England area, what lane to be in of the two or three turn lanes on the specific ramp...if you \"guess\" wrong, you're toast! So on this last trip we took to Maine from Virginia, we tested out our Garmin Nuvi 350, mounted on the optional bean bag mount (better than the windshield mount, in my opinion, due to less view obstruction). It got us where we needed to be with no stress, no mistakes, leaving us time to ENJOY the view rather than worrying about making a wrong turn. We even used the lodging features and found a good hotel right near where we expected to be that night in our trip. Called ahead, made a reservation...sweet...as I was conducting that operation in Freeport, Maine, a person walked by and commented how great these GPS units are. On one section of road in Massachusetts, we saw a young guy in a sports car ahead of us with the same unit as ours and his turn signal came on the same time ours did as he was following the route of \"map lady\"...that's what we've named her! Both my wife and I love \"map lady\"...and we'd never take a trip anywhere without her leading the way! I think this GPS device is one of the most valuable tools I've ever had...as good as having a cell phone, if not better! I would characterize it as very close to perfect...but a few things could be improved. One, would like the screen to be a tad brighter (perhaps bigger too would be good) and sharper in daylight, particularly full sun (not that you can't see it, it's just that when you have sunglasses on, it just isn't bright enough for these 55 year old eyes of mine). Second, I'd like to see a feature to add more waypoints in a trip (currently only one can be added). The reason for this is when traveling through Connecticut; we wanted to go on the Merritt Parkway, a very scenic and less congested highway than the selected I-95. The only selections in the unit are for the \"faster\" route or the \"shortest\" route...none for the \"scenic\" route...that would be a nice feature. My workaround method is just to make a number of short routes that take me the way I want to go...and then it was easy to customize the trip. We only came across a few instances where roads where mislabeled - in one case \"map lady\" said \"take exit 23 H when the exit was 23 B...but not a problem since \"H\" was not an option. Bottomline, if you haven't bought one of these, do it now. And if you already have one, you are probably, like me, going to give one to all of your kids that drive so you can be less stressed when they are on the road traveling. My prediction is that when this unit comes down below $200, EVERYONE on the road will have one. Also, in looking into other places to buy the Nuvi 350, there was no better price than what I found on Amazon. The unit came in two days...right out of the box it worked perfectly giving us accuracy to 10 feet...didn't need to read the instructions since it's so intuitive. Even downloaded some POI files that indicated where speed traps are on the New Jersey Turnpike...and indeed when the beeping happened to us with a flashing Speed Trap Warning, we saw a cop had pulled a person over going the other way...how cool is that! So, go get this product right now, you won't be disappointed!! And Garmin, what is your stock symbol...I want to buy a few shares!",

The sound quality is good, however if your like me and like listening to fairly loud music, you might need to check the screen more often to make sure you dont miss a turn. If you do miss a turn the GPS quickly gets you back on track the easiest way it can. I have taken it on long and short trips and hasn't let me down yet. This is a Great buy!! I'm now getting two more for my parents.",

We can move him from one car to another, and he's flown with me on several trips and works great in rental cars (when you need navigation the most). Needless to say, it's on my wife's Christmas wish list. We've used HAL throughout the United States, and he has performed almost flawlessly. We have had one or two problems when we've encountered road construction, and his map is not completely up to date, but that is to be expected with any GPS. The screen is easy to read, the verbal directions easy to follow, and the database of roads and POI's is extensive.

I called Garmin and got a person after almost an hour on hold; she told me I need to talk with custormer support. A half hour later I got a nice lady named Margarite who took care of my registration, selected the new map, and even started the download for me.

Not only does the C340 have a big screen and touchscreen capabilities, it also tells you the street to turn on (with enough time to spare) and the interface is very user-friendly.So why only 4.5 stars? The suction mount. I found out the hard way that it's not too dependable, unless you find the perfect place on the windshield to stick it to. After mounting it onto the windshield and giving it a slight tug, it seemed like it had a pretty solid grip. However, midway through the drive while I was turning, the suction mount along with the C340 just fell off. I understand that the system is pretty heavy, but I don't like expensive technology falling to the ground at random times, so I ended up paying extra for a dashboard mount.But other than that, the C340 is solid product.",

It came with this stubby little antenna you get a decent enough signal driving around in Brooklyn. Occassionaly I would loose my signal but eventually would come back up.I decided to purchase the Gilsson external remote, man what a difference. G2D2 became Kitt from Knightrider. Talking up a storm giving me directions in wooded areas, places with high buildings, and even parts of tunnels. I can't loose a signal to save my life. Most times my signal strength is blue which means 3 or more satalites.Kitt formerly known as G2D2 recently saved my ***. I was in Long island for R.O.H (Ring of Honor wrestling) to most geeks this past Sat. When my buddy and I arrived there was no snow, however we came out to the biggest snow \"blizzard\" in NYC history. Visablity was minimal. Lucky for me I drive a truck that can change to 4 wheel drive with the turning of a knob.You couldn't see anything but white pillows and cotton balls falling from the sky. I couldn't see but the GPS could see me and the road clearly. The audible directions as well as the chimes that come on when it was time to turn worked like a dream. My buddy watched the GPS and I watched the road. It was dark (12:20am) and we had to drive down a couple of wooded areas. I never lost a signal. We got so comfortable with the Gps ablity to get us around we went to dunkin donuts for a quick snack. Eventually we got back to Brooklyn and prepared for the storm. If it wasn't for my Magellan 760 AKA Kitt formerly known as G2D2 before the external antenna.Would I recommend this GPs you ask?HELL YEAH! GET SOME! HOORAH! Sempre Fi! THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT.

He has no clue how to use a computer or hook up a stereo or VCR, (you get the picture). I told him to give it a try and if he still didn't like it I would return it. The very first day, he called me, so excited that he was able to use it and it actually took him right to his destination. He LOVES it! It has always been accurate and he loved the fact that the antenna is built right in, so there is no additional installation.

It doesn't do that. Oh, it could, but the designers never thought of it. I can enter \"Rome\", but it tries to make a driving route to there from California. After a long while it bombs and says \"out of memory\", then takes me back to California. It's so stupidly single minded it is unable to just go view an area for a while. My Toyota in-car GPS is pretty darn limited, and unimaginative, but it will at least do that!Other things on this little device are similarly restricted. Perhaps if the developers spent less time putting extra junk on these things, like Bluetooth stereo music, and actually tried using the device as a map for a while, they would go \"duh, oh, yeah\" and finish the software.I hate products that don't fulfill their promise.

It is so easy to use, just plug it in, touch the screen to find where you want to go. Then listen to the instructions. The synthetic voice technology has progressed so much. I thought that everything would sound like Stephen Hawking but it is a very clear female voice that guides you on to your destination. The price was fantastic and well worth the money.

It fell off two to three times a day, and in the end I gave up of the idea keep placing it back, and replaced with another unit (Roadmate 700) that came with a different design of suction cup. This time, it held it better but still gave similar problems, only two to three times a week instead. But still it was a nuisance, so I returned it and got Roadmate 760 two weeks ago. The suction cup that came with this unit is a total winner. No problem whatsoever on my Hyudai Santa Fe. The software is also much improved so that I can do multiple entry of destinations etc. which was not a possibility before. Overall, I rate this product 5 stat because of the intuitive software, good database, good price and very visible screen (even in sun light), and highly recommend it.",

        "review_text": "Got this unit to replace my Garmin 360 that was stolen. Same look and feel as the 360 but it comes with a traffic receiver and the european maps preloaded.PROs Easy to use, very compact. Touch Screen is very crisp and clear. Fast and very sensitive satelite receiver. I cand pick-up a fix even inside my house or in an airplane (close by the window).It is more of what Garmin got us used to getting which is close to perfection.I started to appreciate and use the Garmin-Lock feature since my other Garmin unit was stolen from my car (unfortunately not locked). People do not realize that when a GPS is stolen the thief gets access to your favorite and home locations. The garmin lock prevents them to use the unit.Hands free feature is very nice. It'll download your contacts from from your phone and dial them at the touch of the screenCONs Inability to insert more than one via point when you plan a trip.Traffic receiver not very useful unless you live in a supported area (big city). Also the trafiic receiver is an external unit you need to plug in to the Nuvi and it doesn't work if the Nuvi is not in the cradle Would have made more sense to have it integrated. Hands free lacks voice recognition and it doesn't support \"Voice Commander\" from MS that I use on my ATT 8525. Also if you listen to an audio book and a call comes in the audio book does not stop so you have to go back afterwards to catch up what you missed.Unit came with outdated maps but Garmin will send you an update for free if you register the unit and call them up. Overall I'm very happy with this baby and would recommend it strongly. My 4 stars is because the CONs I mentioned above and actualy I would give it a 4 and 1/2",

When it did loose signal, it came back within a few miles. It displays the route for you when it looses signal. It found gas, and food for the family on several occasions. I originally bought it for my wife, who is a realator. It takes her door to door with her clients. She doesn't have to do dry runs the day before. The clients get a big kick out of the way Hallena anounces the turns. The suction mount is surprisingly good. I haven't used it in the winter, but in warm conditions, its great.

Likewise for missing, changed or incorrect POI's. In strange cities, POI restaurants may already be out of business. POI listings of chain/box stores and restaurants are incomplete.You have to be brain dead to miss the voice instructions -- usually at least 3 reminders before any turn.I've subscribed to audible books for a few years and the ability to play them on the unit is very convenient because it automatically pauses the playback for voice instructions.My internal speaker broke within 3 weeks, had to get an RMA -- internal speaker volume even at the top level is low for highway road noise -- but running sound through car radio with a cassette adapter is better than the internal sound system anyway -- even with speaker repaired.I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!!!",

        "review_text": "I used the Nuvi 370 in December 2007 when for a business trip that brought me to Germany, Austria, France and the Netherlands. The map and the mapping software is very accurate. As expected, the pronunciation of non-American streets is incorrect but that is to be expected. The important thing is that as soon as my rental car left the Frankfurt International Airport, the GPS was up and running immediately and brought me to many beautiful European cities.Tips for a better experience:1. Put a drop of water (say from your Evian bottled water) on the suction cup before attaching it on the windshield. This will prevent the suction cup from falling.2. SLOW DOWN when you are about 2 or 3 miles from your exit. It's way to obvious but the reason why most people miss their exits (even with a GPS) is that they are driving way too fast. No, it's not the GPS's fault.The Nuvi 370 is absolutely worth the money. I've used it the US too and it's been flawless so far.Bottomline - works as advertised. The other most important thing that the unit has is the currency and unit of measure converter. The others (mp3 player, bluetooth) are regular add-on, not too impressive but maybe useful for other folks.",

        "review_title": "AWESOME!", 
        "review_text": "I ordered the Garmin 350 after doing extensive research on Amazon, Consumer Reports and other websites that rated the product. I also did a test run at Best Buy where the sales person was telling a group of people that Garmin was the best from a satellite and maps perspective. The price of the Nuvi 350 was well over $100 more than at Amazon.com. AND, they were out of stock, which tells me that even over $100 more it was a good selling item. My motivation to purchase a GPS was due to getting lost in a very unfavorable/dangerous section of Philadelphia where as a female alone I was afraid to stop and ask for directions. I was using Mapquest directions that do not take into account construction detours.I have used the Garmin Nuvi 350 for several road trips since my purchase. I cannot be more pleased. Navigation through the unit is extremely user friendly. I simply type an address and hit \"Go\" and I'm on my way. You can add an additional stop to your route and incorporate it into the bigger trip. You can type in key words to a business you might be looking for and it will pull up all listings in the area with that key word. For example, if I am looking for directions or the phone # to Biltmore Winery, which is part of the Biltmore Estate, I simply type in Biltmore and choose from the list it presents me. The Nuvi will also give you listings by hotel or restaurant type and list them by their distance away from your location. You can chooose Chinese, Italian, Steak house, Fast Food, etc. Or you can choose ALL and see what is close to you.The voices are clear and audible on this unit. It is a cynch to snap in and out of its holder, which suctions to your window. It has a leather case to keep it in when you are using it on foot to navigate through the city. The colors are bright and friendly to the eyes. You can store a list of favorite places and there is a button for \"home\". Start up is quick and the routes that have been chosen so far are efficient. It may not choose the route that you might usually take, but it does choose good routes from my experience. It recalculates the route immediately if you take a different turn and get off the original route it provided for you. I traveled to Portland, OR to visit a friend. I programmed his address into the unit and from there was able to drive my friend to work, go sight seeing on my own, drive back to his work and pick him up and drive straight back to his home. This was no easy feat with all the turns, interstates and highways that I was not familiar with. However, with the Garmin Nuvi 350 it was so simple to navigate through traffic without a worry. It was incredible. I would be lost without it! No pun intended!One thing I have noticed, which would be the same with any GPS I imagine, is that when you are parked in a totally enclosed parking garage it takes a moment for the unit to calculate your route. You must get out of the garage into an area where the satellites can reach the unit in order to calculate the route.Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with the Garmin Nuvi 350. I am not a person that would score this unit less than a \"5\" b/c of lack of reception in an enclosed parking garage, which would most likely be the case with any GPS unit. The benefits and features, ease of use, feeling of safety for me and my service from Amazon make this product a solid \"5\" in my opinion.",

Check your cig plug. Most power issues have to do with auto cig plugs that are a little too small. I never had problems, but I use a Radio Shack swivel 2-1 adaptor (use the radar detector at the same time) that works great.3. The sound on these units is the loudest and clearest out there. I'm really baffled by your comments on this one.4. Yes there is. You can add any address at any time to favorites. If you're talking about way points without an actual address, there's even a way to do this, although not as easy as on the Garmin.Check out the tips on gpspassion.com5. Yes there is. The Roadmates will be upgradeable via USB or CF, and will have updates annually.6. Read some of the many other posts and realize that Magellan gives their gooseneck mount free. It is an excellent mount, but yes, I agree with you that multiple mounts should ship with a unit of this price.7. Auto contrast may be hard to notice. My unit is easy to see in all types of light, even bright sunlight with sunglasses on. You do know those settings are adjustable, don't you?8. I rarely lose blue WAAS lock, even in the city. I've driven through really bad storms, including heavy sleet without losing it. It's an known fact that weather has little affect on GPS. If you can't get a good signal, maybe your unit was in fact bad.",

Hotels - as I'm driving along interstate I can find hotels at increasing distance from where I am - phone numbers are there - I can dial through bluetooth on unit & phone. 2. Restuarants - in area you don't know, can search out in distance from where you are - find type / style / chain you want to go - hit the place and your route is mapped out.Has only steered me wrong once - in rural Wisconsin a road had changed so it had me for a short period on a dead end road. Easy to \"force\" your way out of it, start heading in direction you know you are heading (West in this case) and soon it \"reroutes\" you and the dead end road was out of the picture.Much better than laptop alternative for me all round. I haven't used Europe maps yet, or the traffic alert information. Startup time could be a bit better - but it does have to acquire the satellites.",

        "review_text": "I live in Manhattan and have used the Garmin 350 Nuvi for about a year. On narrow streets, it's hard to get the initial satellite connection. It's even worse if you're moving. It was able to achieve satellite connection best at an intersection. The Garmin does not work well under scaffolds (duh!).Also, I find in major highway intersections (I'm talking about crazy roundabouts, twists, multi-layered highways such as the \"intersection\" of the West Side Highway, George Washington Bridge, I95 and, I87), the Nuvi is at a loss. It helps at times like these to pay attention to the purple path delineated on the Nuvi.Also, the OEM suction mount is absolute garbage. Leave it in the car on a warm day, and it turns into a messy goo. I replaced it with a bean-bag like dash mount, which has worked fine, but it costs an extra $30.Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Nuvi, StreetPilot I Series & C530, C550 (010-10908-00)For the price, you cannot find anything better. And I felt this way a year ago when prices on this thing was $600. I took the Nuvi to Toronto, CA, and it saved me many times. So in that trip alone, I thought the purchase was worth it. So, the NUVI is not perfect, but the interface is better than most, and definitely worth the money.",

        "review_text": "This is the first GPS I have owned but I have used other GPS before in Rental cars and in-car GPS. Overall I will recommend this GPS.Review:1) Maps were quite up to date and Garmin provides the free update for the latest maps for 2008. To get the update one has to register in the Garmin's website and provide the serial number of the device. It takes around a month to get the update from Garmin.2) Routing is very good but sometime it is slightly incorrect or quirky. The device routes me through two different routes from my home to the highway without any specific reason. Though the distance is very similar, one of the roads has more traffic light and is slower. I am yet to find a reason why the device choses one route over the other on certain days.3) The text to speech is really useful. You don't have to take your eyes off the road to check the map to make the turn.4) Bluetooth phone integration works very well. The audio quality is not the best that I have heard but it is definitely better than most of the bluetooth speaker phones. Coupled with that you can enable the Bluetooth \"push' feature if your phone allows it. This enables you to see the phone's directory on-screen along with call history. The coolest feature that I have found is to able to listen to the SMS that you receive while driving.5) Traffic routing works well in my area i.e \"San Francisco Bay Area\". I have also used the traffic routing in Denver and it worked very well. Although the traffic system needs few updates which I believe is possible since TMC provides these information. The traffic incident report is typically quite vague. It says \"slow traffic\" or \"accumulating traffic\" on the highways. It will be much more useful if the actual speed on the highway is also mentioned. I have seen that sometime the slow traffic implies 20 mph and sometime it is 50 mph. It is often very difficult to decide to avoid the traffic bottleneck based on these information. Also the time taken for the traffic information to update is slow. It is almost close to realtime in my experience for building up the traffic delay but it takes way more time to clear the incident report. I think this will help if Garmin includes speed data in the traffic report.6) The suction mount works well. My car has a flat region on the dashboard so it was much easier to mount.7) GTM-12 traffic receiver is not integrated in the GPS. Often it is a hassle to connect the traffic receiver.8) POIs are not that extensive.",

Remember to know the names of any sights you want to see in their native languages prior to leaving for your trip (this will save you a lot of time). Loading in additional addresses to your favorite locations is easy. Still, realizing that the accuracy of domestic GPS units is much better now than a few years ago, I guess I cannot complain. The military satellite accuracy is what the private companies need to strive for, but then again we would most likely see that cost in the price of the end-user units.I did, however, have to send back my GPS back to Garmin since the windshield mount power supply/FM traffic receiver outlet did not work. Their customer service has been great so far.I received the new unit back and it works at 100%. The traffic receiver function was the issue. It comes with 3 months of service, but it can be purchased for $60/year from Clearchannel in the US. MSN has a service with the 680 model, but it seems to be a young area of growth. So far I cannot comment on the accuracy of traffic, but it picked up major construction in my area.",

        "review_text": "I've had this for a few months. I didn't get it from Amazon and when it arrived it was DOA. I called Garmin tech support (I did have to wait a while) and they were extremely helpful. I was concerned that since I didn't buy it from an authorized dealer, I would have some problems. But I didn't. I didn't even have to pay for shipping. They sent me a shipping label and I had the unit back within a week. I bought the 512mb card and could load quite a bit of of the mapquest. It did not take too long and is probably calculates more quickly than the hard drive of the 330.I've had no problems with the window mount. It's been there for over a month and not loose at all. I put a screen protector on it to avoid any scratching. One thing with the screen, if you wear polarized sunglasses, the screen can be difficult to see, so when something important is coming up, I'll take off the sunglasses and the screen is very visible even during a bright sunny day.I love the 3D mode. I think it is easier to see how far ahead a turn is going to happen, especially when dealing with a bunch of ramps.The software is quite good too. I commute to Philadelphia and I have learned some shortcuts with the 320 which was especially helpful during the transit strike. It was also great when driving to Newark, NJ airport. It had the different terminals listed and the directions were right on. It recalculates when you go off route quite quickly. One time I had it set for shorter distance rather than faster route and I was not going the way Darla (my anthropomorphic name for the 320) told me to and there were quite a few exits close together that she was trying to get me to go on plus there were roads above me too. She was having a nervous breakdown and kept saying \"recalculating, recalculating, recalculating...\" Finally I just turned it off to give her a break. When I turned it on again, I changed the mode and there were no more problems and it worked just fine.I recently got a new car and was debating on getting an onboard navigator but decided against spending close to $2000 for it when I had the 320. I can move the 320 to other vehicles with no problem.Unfortunately you can't put in waypoints and save routes. For the waypoints I use my GPS for geocaching.If you're looking for a car navigation system, look no further. This one is great. I used to use my GarminV which just beeped when a turn was about to happen and it was harder to tell where the turn was especially if there were a couple of exits close to one another. Darla talks to you and she speaks quite a few different languages or with a British accent.",

When it works (actually powers on), it will do the job. However, so will just about every other NAV unit on the market.The problem is, when your unit fails (and ours did three times withing the first year), you will deal with the worst customer service on the planet!Our unit broke within 30 days of purchase. The unit's power would simply shut off while driving down the road (and right when you need it the most!). Sometimes, the unit would not even power up from the start. It also would search for the satellite and often lose our location. We tried changing car power adapters, etc. but no go. Fortunately, the first time this happened, we were still within 30 days of purchase, so Amazon was nice enough to send us a replacement unit. However, when the unit would not power on for the second and third time (a few months later), we had to send it back to Magellan.When you call Magellan, you speak with a customer service rep in India! Every sigle phone number that you dial is routed to India! Unfortunately, they have no clue how to help you. To send your unit back for repair, you need to wait for an email with shipping instructions. The problem is, that never comes! In my case, I called them 7 times over the course of 10 days trying to get my shipping instructions and RMA. I begged them for an address and RMA number via phone so I could send it back (and I offered to pay for the shipping), but they will not give it to me. Each time I called, I was told that I would receive the email within 24 hrs.....but nothing ever shows up. I even gave them alternative emails to send to...but nothing.Amazingly, you cannot even speak to a supervisor to resolve your problems or anyone in the US for that matter. You are simply stuck in an endless loop!As I sit here today, I am holding my broken Magellan.....waiting for an email that probably will never come.

        "review_text": "There is no dearth of reviews here. This is a different take on the product. I give it 4 stars because of some unpleasant surprises and some basic things that I believe the product should have designed in.I bought the c340 prior to taking a family vacation by car to Northern California and Oregon.How the C340 made the vacation more pleasant- Less arguments between my wife and I on driving directions- My kids could watch DVDs with the player plugged in to car charger. The C340 has a battery that lasts for many hours (Check if the other products have a battery - otherwise you can either operate the GPS unit or the DVD player and face the consequences of \"When are we going to be there?\")Pleasant Suprises:- Very good coverage of navigation for most destinations from Lassen National Park to Crater Lake to Bandon, OR to Florence, OR.- Type in the address of a recommended restaurant from Frommer's guide in Eugene, OR and be accurately directed to a scrumptious lunch- It's quite remarkable how the unit can accurately \"predict\" your arrival time.Unpleasant Surprises:- The mount was not sticky. The unit fell off a couple of times. Till I applied some good old spit to the rubber that attaches to the windshield and it was \"more sticky\"- The town of Mt.Shasta was not accessible. I tried many different ways. I would have expected Mount Shasta to be a city in California and not \"non-existent\" in the Garmin database- Navigating to a Starbucks in Klamath Falls,OR took me to a Safeway.So, okay, Safeway allows Starbucks to brew coffees in their store but I don't think of that as a Starbucks location. More on that below.What I would like:- I was looking for WiFi hotspots along the way. I had to keep typing in Starbucks over and over again. I wish I could just enter Starbucks one time and store it in my favorites. Everytime I was looking for Starbucks, I would just need to go to my favorites. I expect others might have Chevys or McDonalds or Denny's in their favorites. This would be a good enhancement.- THere is a squiggly line to the lower left hand side that neither the manual nor the unit explains. It looks like bars on a cellphone.

I had not read any manuals and I found it intuitive to use. I was able to put in the address I was headed to and it quickly calculated a route. it wasn't the route I normally took so I turned a different way and it immediately recalculated the route without further input. The unit speaks in a variety of voices and it does give you the name of the street you will be turning on. Very simple to use.The only thing some people may find as a negative is that the pronunciation is not always accurate. However, to offset any confusion, the street name is also displayed on the screen. I haven't downloaded any new voices but I look forward to exploring that aspect of the unit as well!!",

I'm constantly getting lost in my car, so I bought this to help relieve the frustration and high blood pressure. It works fine, just so long as I know where I'm headed and which way to turn ahead of time. Otherwise, I'm in trouble.A few weeks ago I told it to locate the nearest plant nursery. Three times out of three, it merrily led me into the middle of residential areas where there has NEVER been a nursery, and never will be. I asked it to take me to the closest Home Depot, and it happily gave me directions to an empty lot.Today, things got even stranger. First it took me off the main street where I was traveling and looped me around in a residential area, then led me back exactly to where it'd turned me off, and had me continue the same direction I'd been going! Then it led me a mile past my destination, turned me around, and then led me back for no apparent reason.I judge satisfaction for this device by how often I want to kiss it for saving my life vs. how often I want to smash it with a hammer and send it back to its manufacturer, and right now, the hammer is looming larger and larger.My next purchase will NOT be a Garmin!",

        "review_text": "A $199 price point has been the holy grail for retailers for a nice touch-screen GPS unit, and Magellan has done it with the Maestro 3100. I have been using this unit for about one month and am totally pleased with how it operates. The touch-screen works great and the interface is easy to figure out and navigate. I have never looked at the manual. The inclusion of the Sirf Star III chipset means it gets a quick fix and will even work indoors. Using the Navteq mapping software means that the roads are up-to-date. As far as all the other bells and whistles (Bluetooth, MP3, etc.), do you really need those? I have other devices for those purposes. This unit is designed to get you from point A to point B with no hassles, and it delivers. I only have a couple of minor complaints. One, it is slightly difficult to attach the unit to the windshield mount. It just seems like a poor design. Two, it will occasionally lag when navigating. This is particularly evident after you enter a new favorite and click the return arrow to go back. It can take 8-10 seconds...no big deal. Bottom line, this is a great deal for a name-brand GPS.",

        "review_text": "I've used this GPS extensively over the past month and I'm really pleased with my purchase. This unit has some definite advantages over other GPS units that I've seen. The most important is probably that it announces street names. For example, it will tell you to \"Turn left onto Main Street in .3 miles,\" not just \"Turn left in .3 miles.\" If you don't know an area, that's a real advantage. The GPS units that don't tell you street names can leave you wondering, did it mean turn at this light or the last light? If you do make a mistake, it immediately alerts you by announcing \"Recalculating!\" and then gets you back on your route. The unit is small enough to be hand-held and can be used by pedestrians as well (although I have not tested this). The screen is small, but easy to see. The GPS units with larger screens give you more lateral view, but this doesn't seem too helpful since you're always traveling forward, not sideways. All the maps are preprogrammed, so you're ready to go anywhere in the United States, Canada or Puerto Rico, although I've only tested my unit in the US. Its knowledge of the all the streets is pretty amazing. Even tiny little alleys and side streets are recognized by the unit. The unit does have a little trouble finding your destination sometimes. It will get you very close, but is sometimes confused in the last few hundred feet. This is particularly true for large parking lots, like around shopping malls. These are not apparently mapped into the program and the device will show you driving through vast nothingness as you travel through a large parking lot. Equally, on the return trip, the device will sometimes be confused by the parking lot. It once told me to \"Drive .3 miles and make a U-turn\" in a parking lot. What would be the point of that? However, once you've gotten yourself out of the parking lot and onto a road, it doesn't fail to lead you on your way. I'm very pleased with this purchase and recommend it without reservations for anyone looking for a reliable and reasonably priced GPS navigator.",

        "review_text": "This is the 3rd GPS unit I have owned and I am a bit disappointed. First off, the \"intergrated traffic monitoring\" means that the unit is shipped with Garmins add-on GTM12 device. This device is not integrated and needs to be attached to the 370 for operation. The Bluetooth integration is useful, but the volume and quality of the built-in speaker is not great, making it difficult to hear callers. The units detour feature is also more limited than other units I have owned. For instance it does not allow the user to view the chosen route and exclude a road. You are only able to exclude the road that you are currently driving on.Other than that, the maps are fairly up to date, POI database has a lot of information and the screen is pretty decent in most light.Finally, like most other units I have used, it does have a tendancy to pick routes that are not optimal. For example it may route you through the middle of a city because it is the shortest distance (mileage wise)to a destination. This fails to take into account the multiple traffic lights and inherent congestion and can add a huge amount of time to a trip that could have been much quicker if another route had been chosen.If you must have a Nuvi, save your money and buy a 350...the added features of the 370 are not worth the added cost.",

Another cool feature about this unit is the choice of accent/language of voice navigation. The only time I had an issue was when I powered-up without first flipping-up the antenna. For some reason, it took more than 3 minutes to acquire satellites. That day, as I remember, also happen to be rain-cloud overcast.

        "review_text": "After weeks of changing my mind between the Garmin 2720 and the Nuvi I finally decided on the Nuvi because of its compact size, window mount, and extra features. I received it yesterday and this thing is nothing short of amazing. It aquires satellites within 10-30 seconds and is ready to go. Navigating is easy with the full touch screen and the 3D view is incredible. Before purchasing this product I had been using the original Streetpilot III Color Map which for anyone familiar with this has practically no navigation capabilities. The Nuvi is like a breath of fresh air for me. Now I can just select the place I want to go (either pre-entered or on the fly) and it takes me there. I travel a lot - both by plane and car and this will be very easy to take with me on a plane trip and then use in a rental car. Not to mention while on the plane I have an MP3 or I can download an audio book. I also really like the windshield mount - the DC charger plugs into the mount not the GPS unit so all you have to do is place the GPS in the mount and its powered - No fumbling with cords.This thing does it all and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone looking to upgrade or downsize!",

I don't really care for the MP3 playing capability but I have it, I don't care about the audio book feature but I have it.

The package we got included the suction cup windshield mount, a leather case and the various cords and whatnot.You can use it without plugging it in (provided the battery is charged, of course!) and to date it's not steered me wrong yet. We sometimes change the voice (it comes with a bunch of them to choose from, both male and female of various accents). It offers TTS on most of the voices which is important to me. My daughter dances competitively and so I am constantly driving her to competitions out of state, not once has the Garmin let us down.When we first got it, I ran both units side by side for a couple trips and the Garmin does not always give the same directions as the Magellan -- but the Garmin's directions were usually quicker. Another thing I noticed was that the Garmin does not get lost in downtown areas (the Magellan could never seem to acquire satellite signals in any big downtown area).Well worth the cost and when I eventually need to replace it, I'm going with another Garmin!",

It took me quite some time to figure out how to enter in my destination from the get go. While nearing my destination, the unit was preparing to tell me to turn left at the next street. I proceeded to turn and found out it was off by about 200 ft. When the route attempted to recalculate the route, it took no less than 30 seconds before it got me on my way. After my business meeting, I wanted to get back home. This feature was not availabe on the Magellan.

        "review_text": "I got this after reading a number of reviews on different GPSs and it seemed to best meet my needs. I needed a GPS for work because I go to different homes in my city 1-2 times per week. Before I'd look up maps on Google map and print them out. Sometimes I'd find out en route that I actually need to go somewhere else which could be tricky. My thoughts about this one (which is the only one I've ever owned):Pros:--Easy to use and set up (and I'm not very savvy for non-computer based tech devices).--Seems to have up to date maps, at least for my area. Yesterday a client told me that their street had just recently been named and it was on the map.Cons:--Does not usually choose most efficient cross-town directions. I usually ignore these, make up my own route to get the general area and then use the GPS for getting around the neighborhood and finding a specific house.--Does not seem to factor in stop lights at all and always underestimates time of arrival for in-town driving. (I'm told it overestimates for highway driving but I haven't done that yet.) This is a pretty significant consideration for me... Google maps has been amazingly accurate at timing. Since I'm fitting in this driving to try to arrive at a certain time between other scheduled appointments it is helpful to have a fairly accurate time estimate. Now I know to add 5-10 mins to all time estimates on the GPS. I think this might be why it messes up the cross-town routes, too, since it doesn't seem to know that it takes longer to go on surface streets than to take the highway. Not a big deal now that I know, but I do still use Google maps for planning my day when I'm going to an unfamiliar area. Now I no longer need to print out maps, though, which is nice.Overall, this GPS meets my needs for providing mostly accurate (street numbers are occasionally off by one house but street location and general area of street numbers are correct) and easy-to-use directions within neighborhoods in my town. It's been wonderful for the times when there's a change in location when I'm already on the road.",

        "review_text": "I have have a been a long time Garmin GPS customer including three generations of the Streetpilot. I am very pleased with the Nuvi 650 echoing some of the praises you've read here in the reviews.However for those of who are on the fence about getting the 650 versus the 660 for the extra Bluetooth, FM transmitter and traffic receiver, I want to offer you some more reasons to consider the 660. The Nuvi 650 does not include the leather carrying case, AC adapter and printed manual which comes standard with the 660 packaging ($50 value).As a an old time Garmin user, I am used to having these items come with my GPS. In addition, the Nuvis do not include CD/DVD map software nor the friction mount (must buy separately esp. for California and Minnesota). Considering how easy it is now for users to access the memory space of the Nuvi from their computers, it's much easier to corrupt the system unintentially. Thats when you'll need the original map software to recover.Don't get me wrong, I do like the Nuvi 650 over my Streetpilot 2720 for it's size, improve user interface and the SirF Star III receiver for much more reliable GPS reception.

        "review_text": "I have been a long time user of various GPS systems for over 8 years now.I started with the Hertz Neverlost 1st generation all the way to the 3rd generation (made by Magellan).I bought the C320 a year ago after a lot of research, time spent on GPS forums online.I bought a Magellan Roadmate 300 and 850 to compare to the C320 on a road trip from Arizona to Vegas.Both seemed to perform fine, although Magellan software is less intuitive to use and required extra clicks to do the same thing.On the way back from Vegas to Arizona, there was a major accident and the highway was closed. The Magellan GPS gave an alternate route of going through Flagstaff, which was going to add 2 hours to the trip.The Garmin GPS gave an alternate route of going through Williams, which only added an hour to the trip. The Garmin GPS had much better route detail and accuracy.I returned the Magellan units after the trip due to the dismal performance.My friends also purchased the Mio C310x GPS units recently. While they like the Mio C310x, it does not compare to the C320 as a GPS unit. The Garmin C320 is simply so much easier to use, due to the extremely intuitive menu system. The Mio C310x interface is very disorganized and confusing. Not good for someone who is driving and trying to interact with the GPS.Pros:-extremely intutitive menu system makes it a no-brainer to use-very accurate routes-GPS performance is great, WAAS system helps accurate pin-point of location (lack of SiRF chip is no concern here - it works better than the Mio which is SiRF enabled)-the battery lasts a very long time. Most of the time I do not use the car charger at all-SD card based, so no hard drive failure to worry about-menu performance is fastCons:-no mp3 player (not a big deal, I use my 40 GB iPod on road trips anyway)-no bluetooth (I listen to radio for traffic anyway during rush hour)-a bit bulkier than the sleeker nuvi units (but I have a cup holder that fits the GPS unit fine)Overall I HIGHLY recommend this GPS unit if you are looking for an affordable and yet highly usable GPS system.",

        "review_text": "********First things first, i must say that this is the only GPS unit i have used so i have no point of reference*****************I bought this in September of 2007*********I first to decided buy a GPS unit because of my new job. I am a college admissions counselor and during my first travel season, i was required to visit over 80 high schools and about 15 college fairs. After doing some research (mostly on cnet, amazon, and circuit city), I decided to go with the C330 because of expert reviews, user reviews, cost, and the features.I must say, this unit made my job SO EASY.I was able to easily find all but two locations without any problems. The high schools and colleges were already programmed into the GPS so i didnt even have to worry about typing in addresses. The ones I was not able find are diffucult to find anyway, according to people i spoke with. My job does include some downtime but i was able to find movie theaters, golf courses, restaurants, malls, and much more, with no problems. I was also easily able to figure out how long it would take for me to get to my next destination. This unit also allows for me to type in a specific location and then easily look for different points of interest in that area.Initially, my girlfriend thought i was wasting my money. She didnt see the need for the unit. That soon changed when i showed her all it could do. SHe has relied on it on many occasions to get to places. She is not the most tech savvy person but was able to use the C330 with no problems. She now loves having the GPS around and has no complaints.With all that being said, there are a few cons about this unit, including;*The maps are not the most up to date but are still fairly new.*Sometimes the routes chosen by the unit are not the most efficient but not a major issue, i never had any problems getting to my destinations and was never late to scheduled appointments and events*The unit does take a few minutes to warm up (find current location of GPS)THe pros of this GPS definitely outweigh the cons. I was looking at many entry level GPS systems and am glad i bought this one. If and when i do finally decided to upgrade, it will be another Garmin for me.",

        "review_title": "Great unit. So easy to use, even my wife can figure it out.", 
        "review_text": "After using the GPS navigation system that came with my car, my wife decides she wants one also. So knowing my wife and after doing some research we decided on the Garmin StreetPilot c320. We got it for the price, size, features, and I have a Garmin eTrex Legend so I'm very familiar with that brand. We chose the c320 over the c330 because of the $100+ price difference and especially because you get the freedom of loading in only the states/provinces you need. Also since you load the maps using the CD, you can every easily load updated maps using any future updated CD's. I don't know how you would do it when the maps are stored in the internal hard drive like the c330. Also it takes a lot less power to read off of the SD card than a hard drive so the battery will last longer per charge. The unit came with just a 128 mb card and that wasn't enough for us as we travel up to Canada quite often and we live in the NJ just outside of the NY metro area so just by having those two state in the memory card, that doesn't leave much room for much more and that just won't work for us because we ski in the New England states all the way up to Maine and we go to Florida quite often so we'll need maps for those areas. So I got a 512 mb card [...] and I was able to get all the states on the east coast plus Vermont, Hew Hampshire and Ontario Canada including Hamilton and Toronto. So after the setup I compared it with the GPS navigation system that came with my 2005 Honda Accord with the latest DVD mapping software. I found that for the most part they were identical. They both took me through the same route with some minor variations. What I liked about the Garmin is that when you get closer to the next turn it will zoom in closer for greater details of the streets. Then after the turn it will zoom back out to get a greater view. Another thing I like about the Garmin is that it seems to have more Points of Interests (POI) than my car's system. For example, I belong to a Tennis and Fitness club. I don't know the address but knew the name of the club. With the Garmin I was able to search for it using the different categories under Athletic Clubs. The club wasn't even in my car's navigation data base. The only thing I wish the Garmin can do that my car's navigation does is show you the list of turns and roads it plans to take you and the distance away your destination is from your current location. My wife is learning to deal with the mounting location of the unit but wishes that the mounting arm can be smaller so she can mount it on the dash of her car and not take up so much space. Overall she absolutely loves it and uses it all the time. Oh, one other thing that needs improvement is the \"Go Home\" feature. In my car's navigation system when you store your home location, in order to use it you have to punch in a 4 digit PIN. This way if someone steals your car, they won't be able find where you live. With the Garmin it doesn't have that safety feature. So if the unit gets stolen and you've put your home address in there, they'll know where you live. Therefore, to combat that security concern, I put the address of a nearby strip mall instead of my actual address. This way it will get us to a place where we are familiar with and get home from there.",

        "review_text": "We bought this unit and the Garmin i3 for comparison since they are about the same price. I was initially interested in the i3 because it's smaller in size. It's much easier for traveling, especially going to Europe, we are thinking of carrying it while we are walking. But once we compared it with the Garmin C320, we returned the i3. Using the wheel on the i3 is tedious compared to touch screen feature on the C320. It is definitely easier to see the bigger screen while you are driving. And I do think it's worth buying the dash mount because it's a pain to keep pulling the suction cup on and off the windshield leaving circular marks on the windshield. The dash mount does not require adhesive, it just sits there. It works very well.Another comment I want to add is that it is very easy to load maps onto the unit. I live in Calif and if I am in town, there is no point in holding the whole country's map on this unit. The more states, cities you have in your database, the longer it takes you to scroll through to find the state, city, street that you are looking for. When I travel out of state, I just load the other state(s) onto the unit prior to leaving home. That's why there's really no need to buy a 1G memory chip and load everything on there. And that's the reason why I decided not to buy the C330 which has USA and Canada and Puerto Rico on it. Plus the price is another $100 higher",

        "review_text": "I am in the middle of a 4000 mile road trip - the first using a GPS device of any sort. The Garmin has performed to perfection. I have discovered that I prefer to use \"view map\" on those long interstate miles where there are no turns for the next umpteen miles - then entering specifics when I get close to stopping for food, gas or lodging. I have also discovered that by using the (-) key in the upper left that I get earlier warning to turns - which is nice when traveling at interstate speeds. It can be a pain for those states (like California) that don't allow mounting on the windshield - to find a better way to keep the GPS where you can use it. Not a complaint against this particular GPS - it true of all. The POI's seem to be adequate - though I could wish that rest stops on the interstates were marked. However, I think this is minor when compared to the useability overall.Well, I have now completed the 4000+ mile trip. When I first wrote we hadn't been in the little mountain roads of New Mexico or Colorado. I'm more impressed now. Even in canyons with high sides the GPS didn't lose lock but once or twice - and then recovered quickly when the sides opened up. We even found a cafe in a most out of the way location you can imagine - and really enjoyed the food in this little 'mom and pop' operation. The 'recent locations' is a great utility. No matter where we strayed off to, just simply going to recent locations and choosing the address of our motel or hotel brought us right back without a hitch. It even recognized when there were service roads beside the main street and directed our turns into food, gas and lodging at the right place then along the service road to the location. We really had a good experience.For an easy to use, practical GPS without all those bells and whistles - this is a great choice.",

I believe Navigon is a company that is sincere in its wishes to keep their units as up to date as possible and will fix any bugs we make them aware of.I was traveling on Interstate 95 this morning and observed Reality View for the first time. All I can say is \"impressive\". The view was almost exactly as the highway signage was in real live. I hope Navigon continues to expand the number of highway exits that have this feature.

This Garmin Nuvi 350 is just the opposite -- fast, hardly ever loses reception, and brings you in a direct route. If you get miss a turn, it also recalculates quickly.It is missing some of those features that the other Nuvi's have, but I feel like those are not necessary. You're buying a GPS, not a bluetooth phone. This is the best GPS for its price, I think!One thing that could be improved is the database of restaurants, parks, supermarkets, etc. The feature for finding the nearest restaurant or supermarket is useful, but only if the database is complete. I find that sometimes something as well-known as \"Wholefoods\" is not in there.All in all, it's a good GPS. Never get lost again, and go to places spontaneously (instead of printing google maps first)!",

        "review_text": "When I first got the unit, both the application and maps were outdated. I was able to use TomTomHome to update the application to the latest version, but the maps update is nowhere to be found on the web site. I called TomTom Support 866-486-6866. Within reasonable wait time, I was able to talk to a support tech. After verifying the receipt, he added the US map update to my TomTom account without charge. TomTom guarantees the latest map after purchase. The updated map is more accurate than the Magellan 4000 that I purchased just three months ago.I am also enjoying the free real time traffic update right now. But for silly reasons, the free service expires every three months and I need to request reactivations. The traffic data is much better than any free traffic data that you can get from Google or other sources. You do need to have a cell phone with wireless data service and bluetooth to communicate with the server.I like the fact that there are tons of storage on the 20GB internal drive. I can add more voices, color schemes, and custom POIs. There are many free POIs on the Internet. TomTom's built-in POIs are pretty complete to begin with.You have the option to turn on Text-to-speech for voice turn-by-turn prompt. Some people may feel that it may be a little too wordy. I prefer the use of special tones rather than an English sentence at the turning points.The unit is not slim or easily pocketable. But the battery seems to last a long time even with screen on. There are battery saving options that will automatically turn off the screen between turns and turn off the unit entirely when your turn off the car.Overall, I found it very satisfactory as the map and POIs are complete and the unit is easy to operate.

The screen is visible in all light conditions. We have bluetooth in the car, so we didn't need that.

        "review_text": "Although I am new to the world of GPS, I conducted extensive research before making my decision to purchase the Nuvi 350. I read all sorts of reviews, specifications and comments.The rave reviews you see are all true. This thing is really magic. It locks in a signal very quickly and gives very accurate turn-by-turn directions. There really is no need to look at the unit while driving. It tells you everything you need to know. I just upgraded the firmware to the latest version 2.7 via the Garmin website and the mapping is very accurate. I really like the quick access to various points of interest - restaurants, airports, post offices, shops...you name it! Just pop it in and you are on your way.I had no idea there were all the extra features! I though I was buying a GPS and I got a fully functional portable entertainment system in the process. I do recommend headphones or a link to your car radio as the speaker is OK for directions, but not for listening to MP3s.I am looking forward to getting my GTM11 traffic receiver. If that works as well as the GPS, I will be totally thrilled about my investment. It does seem to be a lot to spend but so far, it has been worth it.Of all the negative things I read about this unit, there is only one that I agree with - the Lithium-Ion battery is inaccessible for changing by the owner of the unit. It is supposed to last around 1,000 hours but what I am to do once it goes out? The accompanying carrying case could also be improved with a secure belt clip.All in all, I highly recommended this purchase if you are looking for a simple and very portable GPS device. It also has pedestrian navigation function built into it which will come in very handy in big cities although I have had a chance to test that yet.",

Being in Germany, I HAVE to have something reliable, and especially on my way to a 3rd world country, driving alone, and not speaking their language. Therefore, unable to stop and ask for directions. Thankfully, I was close to a base and able to buy another GPS... one that worked. I am returning the TomTom and have already replaced it with the Navigon. It has yet to fail me.

        "review_text": "I absolutely CANNOT recommend this GPS considering all the name brand options in this price range. I purchased it based on the price and reviews and felt I had done well. I had no need for the extra bells and whistles that others come with, it was a better price. It had a poor interface, but I could suffer with that b/c of the price. It took awhile to acquire a signal, but I could suffer with that b/c of the price. Or so I thought. One time it took over 35 minutes to acquire signal. Another time my wife really needed it (she was driving to an unfamiliar area, at night, in the rain) and it never aquired a signal the whole 45 minute trip. Now I accept it won't stop the rain, can't turn the night into day, but I DID expect it to help her find her destination. She was scared and late for her appointment! I started wondering, , do I need to suffer with that b/c of the price? Well, I chose to call ViaMichelin to see if I might have a defective unit. The polite, helpful, customer service told me the ViaMichelins have a 'quirk'. If the unit was shut off for more than 8 hours, it would take awhile to re-acquire the signal. His suggestion was to power the unit on about a half hour before it was needed, so it would have time to find the satellites. I thought this was crazy, so I decided to return it and shop for another.I settled on the Magellan Maestro 3100. Again, based on price and reviews. This GPS has an interface that is a thousand times more user friendly, has that predictive text thing that makes data entry so much more easy, has a million other features that are far superior to the ViaMichelin, and MOST OF ALL, it acquires the signal within a few minutes. Doesn't matter how long it's been off, if it's raining, or if there's thick cloud cover.The only advantages the ViaMichelin has over the Magellan Maestro 3100 is the fact that it shows estimated time to destination and it has updateable maps. These are too few advantages for my money...",

We had printed out some directions from Google, but we would have gotten lost if we hadn't had this thing with us. It was great! I set it so that it has a guy speaking with an Australian accent and it warns you about 3 times before you need to turn or keep left/right. The screen is plenty big and I didn't have any problems putting things in. You also don't always have to finish inputting the street name or city because it usually knows which one you are talking about before you're done and it gives you 3 or 4 to choose from based on what you put in. This is my first GPS and this one was definitely perfect for my needs.P.S. The navigation systems aren't perfect by any means and any GPS is going to have a few \"mistakes\" about where it wants you to go. These may cost you a few minutes, but I think that the majority of the time these things are pretty accurate.",

        "review_text": "I got this to replace my GPS navigation software I used with my pocket PC. This unit is not nearly as advanced as what I had before. Sometimes it also does goofy routing through a residential area instead of a major road when clearly the major road is the quickest. In the end it gets you there but sometimes you get there in a less then optimal route. The menus are not intuitive. But because it does not have many options, that doesn't matter too much. The manual is poor in that it does not explain some of the screens. I also did not find a more detailed manual on the CD or online at their web site. Sometimes it take a long time to recalculate a route and recalculates over and over for a few minutes for no good reason. Fortunately it is not very frequent that it does that. Battery life after about 4 months using it is short, maybe 2 hours or 3 hours at the most. Now I usually just keep it plugged in all the time. It comes with a car and home charger.With that said it is pretty simple to use and not bad for the price. I got mine on sale online for about $140. For that price I can't really complain. It comes loaded with maps of all of the USA, Alaska and Hawaii in the 1GB SD card. GPS sensitivity is good and it gets a signal from about any place inside the car. The windshield mount is excellent. With a few small changes to the software this little unit could easily be a 4 star unit. But the limitations in the software makes me give it a 3 rating. The touch screen works fine but I would have preferred a QWERTY layout of the letters instead of the alphabetical layout for inputting addresses. At full price I would not recommend it. However, if you are looking for a basic unit, and find them on sale, it will get the job done without a very big bite out of your wallet.With the negatives",

        "review_text": "I placed this review on CNET as well, but thought it would be worth adding on Amazon too.I've read many reviews regarding the Garmin's, Tom-Tom's, Magellan, and other GPS units, and finally decided on the Garmin. This is a great unit and I am glad that I decided on this for my purchase.There are several key factors that make this a great product:1. Screen - Bright in broad daylight, big at 4.3\", easy to use touchscreen2. Interface - Simple to use, especially for those who aren't tech savy3. Favorites - You can save your favorite addresses and name them in the system so you can plan routes from often used addresses over and over (I can't believe how many reviews I read that said Garmin didn't have this - they obviously didn't know how to use the unit).4. Points of interests - Lots of points of interest to look up as you travel along your route.5. Reroutes - Quickly reroutes you if you miss a turn or need to get around traffic - a matter of seconds.6. Satellite reception - Awesome - finds satellites in seconds and has great reception even in structures.7. Variety of map views - The 650 has both 2D and 3D map views, giving you a variety of ways of looking at your route. This is helpful in trip planning.8. Clear voice instructions - The route instructions are loud and easy to hear, even on the freeway.Cons:1. No zip code lookup - This is the one thing I wish Garmin would add to their nav system. Garmin has you input the state, then city, then address every time when inputting new addresses. It often finds the state, city, and address for you after a few letters, but it still would be much easier with a zip code feature. I think they may add this in the near future as most GPS systems do have this feature. It isn't a deal breaker, however, because of the overall performance of the system.Things you'll want to buy:1. Carrying case to protect the unit (Garmin makes one)2. A/C adapter if you want to charge it in a wall outlet (in my opinion, it isn't necessary, since it comes with both a car charger and a USB cord for charging it on your computer).3. Friction mount for the car if you don't want to use the suction cup mount (Garmin makes one).Updating the unit - Garmin offers a utility on their website for updating the unit's software. The latest updates were already on the unit, but it is nice to know that you can update it online.All in all its a great unit. If you are looking for Bluetooth and Traffic updates, then buy the 660, however, it does cost about $150 more currently.",

I did a great deal of both driving and walking during the trip, during which I consulted the unit the entire time, including long after I wanted to drop kick it.Here is a mere partial list of my complaints:* WebUpdater doesn't recognize my unit when I connect it to my Macbook. Possible that MissingSync is conflicting with it but I don't care to debug it.* Didn't work anywhere in Manhattan I frequented (mostly between 34th and 79th). It briefly acquired satellite contact twice but not long enough to provide any use.* Doesn't know alternate names of many roads. So it tells you to turn right on Jackson Street when what you see on the sign is Route 25.* Sometimes tells you \"turn right in point one miles\" when you're driving at 65mph. Effectively that means \"turn right at the exit you just passed.\" It usually says \"point two\" but not always.* Makes odd suggestions at roundabouts. \"Enter roundabout and take the second exit\" apparently means \"enter roundabout and exit at the second street you see.\" What it really should say is \"enter and exit roundabout to keep proceeding east.\"* Thinks anything with \"Lodge\" in the name is a hotel. Not so when it's an apartment building with \"Lodge\" in the name. Major bummer when you're looking for a hotel in a remote location after midnight with two really cranky kids.* Doesn't get a signal through an under-insulated one-story cabin tin roof, even when the strength of the signal is full blast right outside the front door.* Doesn't let you pre-plot your next trip when you're in the midst of a current trip.* No way to \"unstop\" a stopped trip.* Inconsistent way to move back a screen. On some screens you press \"Done\", on most you press \"Menu.\"* \"Do you want to insert a Via Point here?\" is a lame way to say \"Do you want to plan a stop here?\"* Robot voice is annoying and totally unnecessary.* Robotic voice is also confusing. When it says \"turn right in point five miles\" it sounds very close to \"turn right eight point five miles.\" (Pronounce it both aloud in a robotic voice and you'll see what I mean.)Over the course of my trip I estimate that I spent four hours trying to help this thing help me. I'd be generous to say it saved me an hour.",

It has the entire country and Canada preinstalled; no need to connect it to a computer for anything. It's really a steal. We like it so much, I bought two more for my father and brother-in-law.

If you got a 2G card (check by hooking up the unit to your computer), then I suggest you give them a call. They claimed to have just found out themselves (maybe, maybe not!) and would contact me in a few days.As for the unit itself, I love it. It has a great display, viewable from many angles and in direct sunlight. It has all the features I wanted but never found in a single unit (bluetooth, free traffic reports, text-to-speech, voice recognition, multiple waypoints, route planning even if GPS isn't available, and the ability to select points directly from the map). It even comes with options that I didn't think I needed, but now I really like, such as Zagat reviews, branded POIs, stylus, lane assist, and reality view. The lane assist and reality view are nice when going through crazy interchanges in big cities. The screen could be a little more responsive, but I have thick fingers and have problems with other brands, too. Thankfully, Navigon did not waste their time with the extra junk that doesn't work well but seem to be the only selling points for other brands (music player, photo viewer, FM transmitter). I was skeptical of how well a stiff mount would fit in my car, but it swivels at one end at has a ball joint at the other, so you can easily position it in tight spaces. The GPS reception is good, even in downtown Philly and inside my apartment.

Two days after I received it I went on vacation to a NASCAR race in Talladega, AL which is a 14-hour drive from where I live, and this unit got us there with no problems whatsoever. It refigured our route if we decided to go to a point of interest and we made excellent time. I was worried it might miss some of the backroads we were on, but no worries. Awesome.

Oh and the map screen should let you remove the detail from the top to allow you to see more of the map.

I find the maps to contain way less information compared to the C line.This is my first TTS GPS and to be honest it took some getting used to as the voice is not as clear as the standard Turn Right in 500 feet voice...but after a day or so it is no problem at all. In fact you can turn off the TTS if you prefer the regular prompts.I had a real problem getting the Bluetooth to stay paired with my Blackberry Curve...doing some searching I was able to see that by upgrading the BT to the latest software on the GPS it stayed connectedMSN is pretty worthless other than a bell and whistle when it works...I won't be renewing it in a yearGreat GPS for the money as this was Top of the Line for Garmin before the NUVI came out..if you don't need the slim GPS get this one",

While I was aware of the problems experienced by some unlucky buyers, the vast majority of Garmin users seemed very positive about the unit. I can now join the majority. The unit is a breeze to use, is accurate and despite some attempts on my part to throw it off, it recalculated routes very quickly and set up new routes. My only criticism is that, as a resident of California, I cannot put the unit on the windshield and am hesitant to glue the dash-mount disk to my new car. I made a strap to fasten the unit to the steering column, and that seems to work just fine.",

If we changed our routing manually, by taking a different turn, the unit quickly reconfigured a new routing and was back showing the way. I did notice the unit seemed to lag a bit when the roads were getting too close together on the map display. I have always thought highly of the Garmin product line as it has been around for many years in the aviation industry. We had a chance to compare performance with a competing product, name not mentioned here--but it is a common term for Native-American drums. The other unit was OK, but if we altered the route any at all, it persistently seemed to demand we do a \"U-Turn\" and get back on course. Also, the maps on the TT didn't seem to be as detailed as the Garmin product's. I got the delivery from Amazon in plenty of time for a Christmas gift, which was well received.

This was my first time travelling to Atlanta and with the Nuvi, it felt like I'd been there 10 times. First of all, the Nuvi is much smaller than the Roadmate so I could travel with it. I pre-programmed my destinations in as favorites before I left NY. All I did when I got down there was attach it to the windshield, select my location and listened to \"Jill\" guide me to my destination. I've recommended it to family and friends.

The worst part was that the screen was a bit too reflective and hard to read when the sun was at certain angles. Also, certain street names were too long and couldn't be announced correctly. After it was stolen, I replaced it with the C530. It has a better screen and a security feature that prevents it from being used (if stolen). You do have to input a 4 digit number to enable it for your own use, but that's no problem. At least if this one gets stolen, noone will be able to use it without returning it to Garmin (who would contact me). The 530 doesn't announce street names, but I prefer the shorter announcements.

The Nuvi can handle only 1 via point.--Mounted in a mini van/SUV for family vacations in rural areas. The 2720 gives you more control to plan your whole route. But the Nuvi would not be bad either.--The Techie who will use the advanced GPS features.Nuvi best suited for:--Your wife. I'm sorry, but a woman will choose the Nuvi over the 2720 almost every time. It fits easily in their purse.--Traveling by plane and using in a rental car. The Nuvi's ultra compact design makes this the obvious choice.--People who would use the MP3 player, picture viewer, other Non-GPS features.--People who travel in downtown areas, it will have fewer dropouts than the 2720.We chose the Nuvi. The 2720 was nice, but when my wife took one look at the Nuvi her mind was made up. She wouldn't use the advanced GPS features on the 2720, but she liked the MP3 player, etc. on the Nuvi. She loved the compact size, and the ability to run it on batteries in her car without the power cable. The screen is not as bright as the 2720, but it's still very readable.To see very detailed and technical reviews of all GPS receivers, see gpsinformation.netUPDATED December 2007:We've had this unit for almost two years now, and it still works great. In fact we bought a new Lexus with a built in Nav, and we still like the Nuvi better. It has better directions, an easier menu, and text to speech capability.One thing to note, the touch screen on the NUVI will not scratch easily. Many people are concerned that they need to buy a screen protector. This is not necessary. We've never used a screen protector, and I can't find any noticable scratches on the screen. And I can't count all the times that we've dropped it, or it fell off the dashboard. It still looks almost new.",

I took it to a trip and did it let me down. The initial directions were ridiculous. It took me of the highway and put me back on the highway several times. Then, when i reached the hotel, I took the directions for a mall (which has been there for 10 years)... The unit was off by 5 miles. It said you have arrived to your destination but I was pretty far away from my destination. The nice people at a gas station helped me get to the mall. On my way back, the gps just died. I checked the battery and it was dead. Th battery lasted less than 2 hours. I was extremely dissatisfied with the unit. Thanks to amazon.com's awesome return policy, I returned it.",

Having used it now for the past week, I will never need MapQuest or Yahoo Maps ever again. It's also so extremely portable that I can store it when parking, travel, etc. The screen is extremely bright and viewable in all light conditions. I thought that the small 3.5\" diagonal screen would be too small, but it's just right. The text-to-speech is awesome, accurate, and very understandable. The TTS comes in various languages as well (was brushing up on my French). Satellite reception is excellent, fast on many occasions. There are times when it will say \"Poor satellite reception\" but I just reboot the system and it picks them up again. With all of the highlights for this awesome gadget, the best feature is the POI. If you want Chinese food, the searchable POI is extremely powerful. Need a local Target? No problem. How about an Apple store. Easy. It's a Yellow Pages for the entire country. I haven't used any of the Travel Tools, but I'm sure they're just as good. Highly recommended.",

Hasn't happened yet. When I switch to msn direct, it gives me traffic reports in the Boston city itself, 17 miles away, which I'm not interested in, and although I have traffic as an avoidance in my gps settings, it leads me right into the most congested route. So I don't get what the hype is about, besides calling the street names and giving me weather report. I wouldn't renew my msn direct subscription.

        "review_text": "I bought a Garmin nuvi 350 especially for a trip to New England, a trip that would take us through three States and many, many small towns and back roads. I'd read about reception issues, so I purchased the external antenna as well.I am glad I bought the external antenna. I believe that made a lot of difference in satellite reception. In terms of accuracy and overall usefulness, I'd rate this unit a full five stars. If we programmed the destination appropriately, the system would get us there reliably.The interface is fairly user-friendly; I was able to use it effectively out of the box without too much difficulty. I do wish there was an in-route screen button for \"update me on current location and next turn\"-- however, that information is usually visible at the top of the screen, so I can't complain too loud. And when you deliberately depart from a calculated route, it would be nice to have a button that told the system immediately that you had done so consciously, and kick-start a \"re-calc.\"I give the unit fours stars largely because of the lower usefulness of local data. Nearby grocery stores flagged by the nuvi, for example, included a liquor store I wouldn't have entered on a dare! We wandered around Waltham MA following the nuvi's guidance, looking for a full-service market, and finally stopped and asked directions at a gas station.Part of my travel involved finding old pre-Revolutionary War cemeteries, for some of which I had only map coordinates. Being able to plug in these coordinates was invaluable in driving directly and reliably to these locations. And when we found gravestones of interest, we could use the \"my current location\" feature to get a fairly accurate fix on our ancestor's grave, for future reference (out to five decimal points of a degree).The funniest experience I had was in taking the ferry from Grand Isle County VT westward to Plattsburgh NY. The system got me to the Vermont-side ferry landing and onto the ferry just fine. But a few hundred yards off shore it went crazy, \"recalculating\" over and over again until I shut it down (well, went back to the main menu). However, when I was a few hundred yards off the NY shore, I restarted the GPS function, and it resumed giving directions like nothing had happened! A similar thing happened on my return later that same day.All-in-all the unit performed as expected. And it was a great convenience for reducing anxiety while driving in completely unfamiliar territory. I'd buy it again.***UPDATE*** [7 July 2009] After updating the GPS data-base (Garmin gives you one free update), I traveled again from Grand Isle VT to Plattsburgh NY. This time the system did not go crazy while over water; the map showed the ferry route, and the GPS performed as though we were on solid highway. Just thought you'd want to know.",

        "review_text": "This thing is freaking awesome! I purchased this unit for my wife, as she's been going on about a car navigation system for a couple years now, plus I was sort of out of good Christmas gift ideas. I looked at the feedback on some of the cheaper models and deciced if I was going to get a medium priced unit I'd get the one that was a little more money, but had better reviews. I really didn't know the full capabilities of these things until we fired it up on a trip to the Rockies for a holiday vacation. We didn't read the manual, we just turned it on and played with it. It was very easy to use without instructions, as a matter of fact, we stil haven't read the manual. I was blown away that you can find eateries, hotels, and just about any other landmark besides addresses on this unit. Little hole in the wall, greasy spoon joints, or 5 star restaurants all come up. I couldn't even get away with my usual fast driving as my wife just needed to look on the Magellan to see how fast I was driving. That part I don't like...LOL. I loved the feature that shows how far to your destination, and how many minutes it should take you to get there. I did notice the one part of the manual that I did glance at said something about an external antenna, and I was disappointed that maybe we wouldn't get good performance until we got one of those. I ordered the Gilsson model but it came while we were gone, and now I'm not sure we need it. It was fast enough for me with signal aquisition, with the standard attached antenna. Now all our family members want one of these, and I want one too, for my own car. Perhaps the coolest invention since Tivo.",

Those are my only complaints.One other comment is that when I read the \"What's in the box\" list, I did not think that it included a charging cord, so I purchased charging cords (Car and Home) from Gomadic.

For example, it will say \"make a right onto Teaneck Road in 3/4 of a mile.\" Then when you get to the turn, it will say \"make a right on Teaneck Road.\" Some units are advertised that they give voice prompts but be careful. Some only say \"make a right in 3/4 of a mile,\" and then when you get to the turn will not say anything. Some newer units don't even give voice prompts and this is something that really is helpful when on the road. On the screen, a large arrow appears when you need to make turns. It recalculates if you miss a turn. You can update the unit's maps using the included software. There's even a battery meter to show how charged the battery is.",

        "review_text": "when you know where you're going and you take a different turn from the GPS route, it is very quick to recalculate (seconds). It will try to get you back on the original route (sometimes several tries) but when it sees that you aren't going to, it quickly recalculates. (Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.)The lane feature is great. The reality view of the signage is not all that important to me but the orange lane arrows on the picture of the highway are great. Also, when you come up to an interchange and your route is to keep going straight, She tells you to keep left and the reality view pops up and shows orange arrows going straight in all the lanes that are going straight. It's not critical for me to know I'm going straight through since that has already been established but the lane arrows are very handy in those situations.You can set it up to warn you when you're over the speed limit. I set it for 15 over. This is very handy when you are on highways in the city and can't use cruise control. When you get a little too exuberant, she just says \"caution\" and a little caution sign appears next to the speed limit display. Very nice!I have found the destination announcements to be very accurate. Plus, she tells you which side of the street it's on - I never can remember that address rule.I haven't used the Bluetooth connection to my phone yet - nothing to report there.The only time I used the Zagat POI info was when I wanted to find out the prices at a pricey restaurant. The restaurant's web site wouldn't tell me. However, finding the nearest (non-Zagat reviewed) restaurants has really been helpful.Telling you the street and highway names is great. Less time looking at the GPS rather than the road is better IMO. Sometimes the pronunciation is off. Kinda like someone from out-of-town would do.The larger screen is a must for me. I use 2.00 diopter reading glasses and most of what I need, I can see on the unit without my glasses. Some stuff is small, e.g. estimated time of arrival, and requires my glasses but with the voice and the orange lane arrows I'm generally good-to-go.I highly recommend the Navigon 7100. I'm almost to the point where it is a necessity. What better thing for a man - we don't have to stop & ask for directions anymore - right, like we ever did that.",

Also, once or twice it did get a little turned around when close to the location, but that was taken care of by drivig around the block and looking again.Once the unit hung, and I had to perform a hard reset, and sometimes it takes a little more than a minute to get a lock on the satellites.But this little beauty really made our driving much more enjoyable.

It functions great and is quick enough that I don't feel like I wait on it. My biggest complaint is the holder to attach the unit to the windshield. I read the reviews about it being loose and really tried to be careful with it. It became so loose in 4 months that I had to call and get a new one. They sent me a shipping label to return it and got a new one in under a week. Driving down the street the new holder just snapped and the GPS unit went flying to the ground.

At first I wanted a Garmin because that is what everyone was telling me to get. But theirs with that criteria were beyond my budget. A friend recommended this model and decided to go for it.Wow, he was not disappointed. After a few months of my husband using it, he says it is the best gift I have given him in 20 years of marriage. He travels anywhere from Boston to Florida for work. If he's driving its in his car. If he flies, he takes it along and used it in rental cars. He says it works absolutely amazingly. He is very impressed with its performance and features. After years of trying to quickly get out of the parking lot at Newark airport, this gps showed him a route that no signs there shows and he was out and on the highway so quickly he was totally amazed the gps found this route. Everytime he does it, he still comments on it. Says it was worth every penney JUST for that. lolI have never been motivated to write a review before. But we are beyond happy with this model that I just had to make sure to help others with their research. So we highly recommend this unit and all its wonderful features.",
