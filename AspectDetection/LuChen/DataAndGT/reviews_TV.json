Easily viewable from greater angles than I expected. Picture is not washed out by lots of sunlight.-Delivery guy was great. He called to set up appointment to deliver, calling me again before arriving to give me time to get home. After bringing it in and setting it up, he helped us connect it to our other components. (I think it was delivered by Eagle Trucking.)-Purchase experience from Amazon couldn't possibly have gone better. I was unable to follow the tracking info for the trucking company. Emailed Amazon about it and had personal and immediate attention to help me figure out the delivery situation. There were 2 price drops during my 30-day \"grace period\" which I emailed Amazon about. Had a refund of the drop amount and an email informing me within a day.One of the best all-around buying experiences I've ever had!",

        "review_text": "Amazing Clarity. Awesome, accurate color. This Plasma display is even better at home connected to Dish Network HD box (saw it at 1st at Circuit City/Costco/Sams Club). The HD channels had my wife and me entranced until it was WAY past our usual bedtime. Now let me tell, we were watching without any of the color tweaking recommended by an independent review site (DTV, I believe). We were simply too busy counting zits and hair follicles on the announcers heads. Even the standard def channels looked better than my prior TV (RCA 50\" inch DLP, ~3 years old). I used my old $50 DVI cable (a generic internet brand from Ram electronics)hooked up to a DVI-to-HDMI converter. No need for those over $100 expensive brand names. The sound quality was also quite good (again better than my old set). The remote has large numbered buttons and easy navigation. I haven't coded the other remotes in yet so I can't comment on htat aspect. One site did comment on power consumption (quite high compared to other plasmas), but if you see the picture you might well conclude it is worth it. Tonight, I'm watching the Lakers and a movie (these and sports/golf are my 2 main TV activities), so I'll update on DVD picture quality later. I'm giving it 4 stars (just wanted to be honest) because I haven't set up the universal remote feature and the DVD picture, but up to this point I'm really happy with my purchase!",

I currently have a 19\" trinitron and this may not be as sharp, but really looks great. For the price, having a 27 inch gaming screen is sweet. The games look really nice and response time is fast. I then setup the S cable for cable and routed the audio in as well. Once I fixed the resolution on the PC, it actually is a better PC monitor then TV I think. Hint, set your computer resolution to 1280x 720. This seems to be the best. Anything other and my text/fonts looked unreadable. I was close to frustrated and figured this out and it rocks. I wish the TV resolution was as nice. Still seems grainy Maybe it is my cable provider too. I was able to keep my other TV connected to the cable box via the coax connection and using the svideo for my new tv. Side by side, I don't see much difference between a 10 year old toshiba and this new LCD. I do enjoy the PIP though while working on the PC and watching TV on the side. :) Very trick option. Even though the speakers are not earth shattering, they are loud enough for a bed room TV. Lots of connection options with this TV. Not bad for the 800-900 range.Hope this helps. So far, very pleasedChuck",

So even if you don't have a surround sound system you won't be dissapointed in what this set gives you with its true surround sound. I've had the set about a week now and everthing is great. If you have any concerns about the delivery put that to rest as well. The delivery was excellent.Like all electronics this will probably be a dinasour in about a year but remember this is 1080P so you will be ahead of the curve (for awhile anyway).

        "review_text": "to a casual observer like me, there's not really a noticeable difference between the Samsung and its higher-end competitors (e.g. Sony). For someone coming from a lifetime of standard def, they all looked amazing. So you really have to make your decision on the way the TV makes you feel. Remember, your new TV is going to sit (or hang) in your living room or bedroom for many years to come. You wouldn't want to buy an expensive painting and then hang it in a cheap frame, would you? The Samsung was by far the most visually appealing to my eyes. I currently have mine on a TV stand, but it would look equally good mounted on the wall. It really is like a work of art. Now, I don't play video games and I am not a huge movie buff, so I'll leave the discussion of the pros and cons of the Samsung's features in that regard to the other reviewers. I bought my TV primarily for watching sports, and I have not been disappointed (football, baseball, golf, basketball, hockey -- they're all amazing to watch in high def). Some of the night games look a little dark and grainy on the TV, but if you play around with the brightness feature on the remote you can usually make it look pretty good. There is no ghost effect. The sound is nothing special but perfectly adequate for my needs. As others have noted, the TV takes a few seconds to turn off an on, but that's such a minor annoyance its almost not even worth mentioning. So, if you're in the market for a mid-sized LCD, I would highly recommend this model.",

The fact that the LED DLP lasts the life of the TV is what did it for me, since I was planning on buying a Samsung DLP anyway. Before purchasing this set I saw that there was also an HLT5089S that was very similar. After visiting the Samsung website I still couldn't figure out what the difference was between the 87S and 89S model, so I called Samsung. They said the only difference is that the 89S model has Bluetooth capability, which isn't something I need. I currently have a cable box/DVR, XBOX 360, and the Pioneer XBOX 360 sound system hooked up to it. The Game Mode on this set looks really nice. One of my favorite shows is Planet Earth and that just looks sick as hell in HD on this set. The sound on the TV is ok, but I would recommend hooking up a sound system. After my purchase I registered this product on the Samsung website and they gave me 3 more months of warranty coverage for free. I also purchased the matching stand which was fairly easy to set up.",

        "review_text": "I did painstaking research for months to find the right tv for our living room. I had narrowed it down to this one and a Toshiba in the same size. I liked this one due to the 4000:1 contrast and its sleek design. The picture quality of this tv is amazing, let me say that again... amazing. The HD channels that I receive is truly sharp and crystal clear. But and I do mean but this tv is ahead of its time. Congress passed a new law that all television programing must be digital by February 2009. Currently the majority of tv is viewed in an analog signal. So on a tv that is so sharp and so crystal clear it actually makes the picture of an analog signal seem at times blurry or less than even a tube tv. This is due to the signal attempting to upconvert to the performance of the tv. This is regardless of how it is hooked up. I use the composite, component and the S-video and it seems like the S-video at this time is better. That of course will change when all programming is digitalized. It is like taking a digital photo with a 2 MP camera and then trying to enlarge the image on your computer, it can become a bit distorted but then taking that same image with a 10 MP camera the image is much clearer, much sharper and all around a better quality. That is what will happen when all programming is made digital. This will occur slowly over the next two years but it will happen. Watching a dvd is amazing on this tv, watching HD is amazing on this tv, watching other channels not so good but that is going to be for any tv that has such a high contrast and the price is great as well. I bought this for just under $1100 and then noticed that it was even cheaper now, after calling amazon they credited me the difference so everybody won. This shipping arrived much faster than the website stated. In fact an entire week earlier. Would definately buy from Amazon again and have no worries with using Eagle shipping. This tv is the best product in the 32 inch class and has one of the best price points. You will not be disappointed I know that I am not.",

Then it fixes itself and looks as if it never happened, well luckily its still under warranty and hopefully it can be fixed and never happen again, but anyway back to the tv. 360 looks amazing on this tv, regular xbox looks just ok. as for pc hook up its ok as well, the text is really small but playing videos from your computer looks really good and its not bad as a computer monitor. There are 3 things I don't like about the tv, the remote the glossy finish, and it takes awhile to turn on. The glossy finish does look classy but it scratches really easily and I don't like that I like my tv looking new you can't see them far away but when you look at it up close its very noticeable. Yes and the sound and remote is week but not horrible as some people say I actually don't mind the remote.

I ordered the TV on a Thursday and it was all setup and sitting on my living room by Tuesday at noon. Amazon used a carrier called Eagle Delivery to deliver my TV. The TV came a week sooner than the expected delivery date shown on my Amazon online invoice. Eagle gave me a call the night before my TV was to be delivered, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received the phone call. They setup a time with me for the delivery and when the delivery man came, he called my cell phone and was in and out of my home with no problems. He unpacked the TV and turned it on to make sure it was working. He also offered to take all the packaging away for me. So all in all, I was very pleased with the service from Eagle and the ease of ordering my TV through Amazon. For all of you who are hesitant about buying things online, especially something as big and expensive as this TV, don't be. Amazon and Eagle did a great job and they exceeded my expectations. It was actually more convenient to order this TV online since the TV was literally moved into and setup in my living room for me!",

        "review_text": "As I'm sure like a lot of you this is the most expensive TV that I have ever bought. I spent a long time researching and reading about large screen TV's. At first I was leaning towards a Plasma but was worried about burn in so I decided on a DLP, and with the LED and no color wheel to break down or make noise this set was for me. Also Consumer Reports had much good to say about this set.I recommended that you make sure that it is bought and ships from Amazon as that will eliminate any problems like other have had if you read the other reviews. When I ordered this set it was $1408 and dropped to $1179.99 the next week! No problem, one call to Amazon and they credited my card with the difference. They are the best! I put my order in on Saturday and it arrived the next Friday 5 days before Eagle's estimated delivery date. They called the day before as promised and it arrived on time. I was brought in and un packed and checked out including operation and hook up.The set is everything I had hoped for and more. HD picture is amazing and the Digital channels on my cable are nearly as good. Set up is fairly easy although I am still learning all the functions and controls. Overall an awesome set and value!!I'm am very satisfied. THANKS AMAZON!!",

        "review_text": "I purchased this unit via Warehouse Deals, (Amazon subsidiary). It arrived in exactly the condition described, and even has the full factory warranty (refurbished unit). The deal was exceptional, (under $1100), and having the Amazon 30 day return policy in place really made me feel comfortable with the purchase.Eagle was great for shipping/tracking, although they only sent one guy to deliver the TV. He was pleasant, and the white glove service proceeded exactly as described, (other than my helping him move the box...rather than have him muscle it onto a dolly and into the house himself). There was absolutely no rush. He helped me put the TV on the stand and patiently waited while I powered it up and made cable connections to ensure that it was functioning properly.Amazon was somewhat poor re communication. At the time of purchase an Amazon rep (via phone) couldn't really give me the specifics about the TV, i.e. condition, warranty, if shipping was \"white glove\". They also failed to respond to a later email query relative to those same issues.On to the TV. WOW!! Just an amazing picture. HD material is truly breathtaking. On rare instances the TV does display the Blue halo/Blue smudge issue that Samsung has already noted as a common defect. The repair of the issue is about a 15 minute job and covered under warranty. I highly recommend that anyone thinking of purchasing one of these take a peek through the AVSForum site. There is a lot of information available about these sets.Non HD feed material is OK. It really suffers when expanded out to 56\". If it is a digital feed the picture is still quite good. If it is an analog station converted to digital via cable box, then the picture really suffers (first 100 channels of Comcast lineup in my area).Connected cable and up-converting DVD player via HDMI with absolutely no problems.Sound is fine for normal viewing, but nothing dramatic. If you want a really immersive movie experience, then you have to route sound through an appropriate surround system.The LED/DLP setup allows for very fast power-up. Excellent brightness. And the lack of concern re having to replace a bulb every 2 - 4 years. The set is absolutely fine for full daylight viewing, (my living room has numerous windows) and in fact can be too bright (will bother my eyes) in Dynamic and/or standard modes.There have been a lot of complaints in professional reviews of this set relative to blacks not being deep enough. I'm not a technician, or in any way an expert, but I'm very happy with the black level. Once again...the picture is amazing. You truly can't appreciate how nice it is when viewing the set in a store with out of the box settings and bright fluorescent lighting.Once the set was adjusted per CNET and/or other professional calibration website suggestions the picture was just incredible. Absolutely NO regrets going with this set over the Sony 3000 series.",

I have had no problems with the TV, being a refurb i was worried. The description said minor damage on TV and Accessory. There wasnt a scratch on either, and it came with everything it was supposed to. When i ordered it WarehouseDeals didnt actually have the TV yet. They got it to Eagle/CEVA about 4 days after I ordered it. CEVA got it to me 2 days later. As soon as the CEVA tracking hit my state i called them and set up a delivery for the next day.

Amazon directed me to Samsung's warranty service and Samsung then directed me to a shop capable of in-house servicing. The shop told me they couldn't fix my problem and told me to get a replacement from Amazon _. After contacting Amazon 3 times to replace it I didn't get any response from them for the next 3 days. Luckily, the piece of dust fell off so my screen looks how it should've in the first place. I'd just like to say I was a bit disappointed in Amazon's customer service.

A call to Amazon and Samsung resulted in a Samsung tech out the next day to remove the dust. While it would have been great to not need a service call so soon, it went smoothly. No complaints.Kudos to Amazon for an amazing price, fantastic service, and teaming up with a great shipping company.Eagle (Ceva) Logistics took the television out of the box, brought it up a flight of stairs, put it on my stand, and made sure it worked.I am very happy so far, and expect to remain so for some time.I purchased the television with a Platinum Mastercard, which extends the MFR warranty an additional year, in the event anything goes wrong in year 2 of ownership. Something to think about if you have such a card.

The sound is much better than everyone says when you use hdmi.On this big set sports are incredible, you feel like you are out there with them, lol. The remote is easy to work with and you can change screen size with one button. The regular channels have a gray bar on the sides which is lousy but when you change the screen size to 'wide-screen-fit' it looks decent.The hdtv channels are where the fun is, the travel channel, sports, music is just terrific.

The main reason I purchased it was to use the RVU functionality without required a directv box in the room. The speakers aren't the greatest, so I would recommend surround sound. The set is ultra thin and there is basically no trim around the outside of the screen. I have limited space where it is installed, so this allowed for a slightly larger screen size.",

        "review_text": "Well, I see many reviews mentioning that the product was great but the experience was terrible. I am not sure what happened in my case, but my local Amazon delivery went absolutely flawlessly. I ordered my set on Saturday, and on Thursday, several voicemails were left for me to call and schedule my appointment. They were ready to deliver on Friday, but I preferred to roll it a day to Saturday so that my wife would not have to take the delivery. Besides, I hadn't bought my stand yet, and was probably agonizing over that as much as I had on which TV to buy.On Saturday, I called the carrier (not Eagle, not the 'new' Eagle... never heard of them, actually), and was given the cell number of the driver with my set. He told me he was figuring on a 2pm delivery, and he showed up at 1:30. He and his partner brought the TV in, uncrated and placed it on my new stand (bought Friday night), hooked in the HDMI cable, fired it up, ran the initial setup menu and left. Ten minutes total, with another five to hook up the home theater (do yourself a favor - prep your components and clean up your cables). By 2pm, I was watching the Winter X-Games in full HD. Frankly, I don't think even my local Circuit City could have made it any easier.As for the set, It cost $150 less than my 36\" Non-XBR Trinitron that I purchased about five years ago, it's big (but not too big) and the picture is absolutely fantastic. If it lasts, I can't imagine a better deal. The quality is there (I even like the little accent light under the logo, and I am normally big on such things), the remote is incredibly easy to navigate, and the overall satisfaction I am feeling right now is on par with any purchase I have made in recent memory.I do not recommend things I buy to others. You need to do your own research and follow your own instincts (and perhaps the advice of professionals). I am willing, however, to say that my choice has worked out very well so far.",

        "review_text": "This experience started with excitement about the price. After watching this particular TV for several months, I was pleased to see the price drop to what seemed an excellent deal.I made the purchase innocently enough, though was struck that it may have taken up to three weeks before the product was available. Still, at that price I was willing to wait.After about a week, I received notice that my package was en route and would be here in a few days. On the day that it was to arrive however, I was informed that the package couldn't be transferred from shipper to shipper. Apparently the carrier who would deliver the TV to my door wouldn't accept it due to the fact that there was the sound of broken glass in the box.I contacted Amazon to tell them that I would be willing to wait for a replacement, but I would like to have it expedited. I was told that wouldn't be a problem, and I was informed that my request would have to go to another department. I was told that I would be contacted by the end of the day.Four days later, after not having heard back, I called Amazon. I was informed that the only shipping choice I had available was the specialty shipper, and that there was no possibility of expediting the packaging. It would arrive in 5 to 10 business days.At this point the wait for the television was getting too long, so I asked to cancel the order. I was sent an e-mail two days later stating that all of the e-mails that I had been sending were missed, and they asked if I would like to proceed or cancel. It was at this point when I called in and made it quite clear that I wanted this nightmarish business finished and that they should cancel the order immediately.It's now more than three and a half weeks since my card was charged and several angry conversations later -- I don't have a TV and I don't have a refund. The order details online state that the unit was successfully delivered to a city 70 miles away from me, and there is no sign that I've initiated a return. My credit card retains the original charge, which will start accruing interest soon, but Amazon has assured me that I will be refunded the full amount sometime within the next four (4) weeks.",

Buying the Plasma TV was an excellent choice. I picked it up for around $[...] after instant rebates. Setup was extremely easy. When I first plugged my cable box into the TV I was disappointed with the picture. Then I found out I needed an HD box and had to tune to special HD channels (located in the 700 range on my cable providers box). Once this part of the puzzle was figured out I havent had any issues since. The stock remote is very easy to use, responsive and functional. I also hooked up a Tivo (Standard definition but great quality anyway) & a DVD player. I don't even want to go to the movies anymore after getting this set.I highly reccomend this unit to the TV buyer who wants a big fancy TV but doesn't want to take out a second mortgage on their house to get it!**UPDATE 9/5/07*** - I was watching this TV 65 days after I purchased it and the set shut off and would not go back on. At that point I could not get the TV to go back on no matter what I did. I did some research and learned this is a known panasonic plasma problem. Luckily I returned the TV to costco right under their 90 day return policy for a full refund. As much as I loved this TV I would now hesitate to recommend it to others.",

        "review_text": "I've had this TV for approximately 2 weeks now - It's my first Plasma TV - replaced a 10 year old 46\" LCD television. After visiting every local store and kicking tires - I was sold that Plasma was the way to go. The clarity of the picture - 160 degree viewing angle with no decline in picture quality and sharp picture during fast moving picture ( i.e. sports ) + the vivid sharpness of blacks / reds / oranges / greens / blues made it pretty easy decision.I went with the PANASONIC b/c of Consumer reports review of last years models. It was rated as best picture for non HD programming over any of it's competitors. Going shopping for these things locally is similar to buying a used car - b/c most stores won't show you anything but a HD signal - but I was able to get one store to show me a digital signal to a couple models and was able to view a DVD of TOP GUN on this and a few other models. Alot of brands will have a significant dropoff in quality from HD to digital signal - NOT this panasonic.The picture in HD is simply amazing. Clarity / sharpness / at all angles of viewing both near and far away from the screen. The speakers are very good too - I will play a movie through the Home Theatrre - but day to day viewing the speakers will be more than adequate for most viewers.The picture in non - HD programming - Comcast digital cable signal. About 85 % of the programming is pretty close to the same quality as High Def. Alot of the cable programming seems to be formatted in anticipation of High Def viewing and look very sharp and clear. Occasionally ( maybe 10 - 15 % of cable programming ) you'll get a feed that's not quite as sharp and ther'es a noticeable decline in picture quality from the HD or normal Digital programming. However - I've checked that same programming on my older CRT television - I found that the ( Non-HD programming with poor signal ) picture on the 50\" plasma is the same quality as what I'm getting on my 20\" non digital television. The only difference is that most of the programming is so much better in quality on this plasma TV that it seems like the picture isn't good for those few broadcasts. BUT - it's not poor picture from plasma Tube - it's just a bad signal that looks worse in comparison to the other channels and/or programming.*** Don't let a salesperson talk you out of this TV if you have a large pictue window. I almost decided against the Plasma tube b/c a circuit city salesperson said the reflection would annoy me with a large window in the room. We have a west facing picture window in the rear with a tree outside the window. There is reflection on this tube - but it's no different than the reflection you'd get with a standard CRT tube television. We just pull down the shades a bit - and we haven't noticed anything that would be bothersome when viewing a program. We bought it with the assurance that if the reflection was an issue we could swap it out for a LCD or other television. We're keeping the Panasonic Plasma!!!!I'm totally happy we bought this TV - and have no regrets for choosing the Panasonic. I'd buy this TV again in a heartbeat. The only thing I don't know about is the longevity of this type of tube - but I'll learn that over time. We spent 400 bucks on an in home 4 year service plan to accompany the TV. The marketing says it will last 27 years if viewed 6 hours per day - but I think that's a little optimistic. I did however learn in my research that this technology has been around for 30 or 40 years so I'm hoping that means there won't be any technical quirks to still work out.Jake",

        "review_text": "All TV's lose brightness as the years pass. To my surprise I have discovered that the latest generation plasma TV's, such as this one, actually maintain brightness better than the old cathode ray tubes did. Therefore this TV will last even longer than the one it is replacing.Projection HD TV's on the other hand, fade in brightness far more quickly than you are used to. And LCD HD TV's, although good in brightly lit rooms, have a limited viewing angle that this TV does not. Your preferred choice is now clear, Plasma HD TV. Go to the Panasonic website to make sure you are actually buying the latest one. Currently this is the TH-50PX60U model.So what can you expect your viewing experience to be with an HD big screen TV anyway? You will have a lot of learning to do. First of all, you will find that most of what you actually watch is not available in HD. No DVD is in HD. TiVo will not display in HD unless you have a Direct TV satellite dish and a special HD TiVo receiver. It may be a challenge for you even to get true HD at all even after you upgrade your digital cable box to HD.DVD's you watch will look near to HD quality, even though they are not actually in HD. Good quality regular TV programming will also look good even if it is not actually in HD. Some TV programming will look absolutely awful on your HD big screen, however, and horrible flaws in resolution and detail that were not visible before will make some programming actually unwatchable.You will soon be able to tell which programs were actually filmed and which were recorded with video cameras, due to the color blotching all video cameras leave. Horrible stage makeup on some faces that you couldn't even see before will also become noticeable when watching some shows!If you do not hook your HD digital cable box up correctly, you won't be able to see HD even on the HD channels. You must hook up the composite video (three video and two audio jacks) or the HDMI or DVI connectors to get the HD feed. If you use the normal video output (one video and two audio jacks or the s-video) you will get a 480 interlaced non-HD picture by mistake.Old fashioned TV is 480 interlaced. Some DVD players have 480 progressive scan. This HD TV has native 720 progressive scan HD. Another common format is 1180 interfaced HD. 1180 progressive will be coming eventually. 720p is currently thought to flicker less than 1180i. 1180p isn't even available yet. 1180i is translated perfectly into 720p on this TV nonetheless so you can watch all modes and will be able to continue to watch all modes for some time to come.This TV has a 10th generation plasma screen, with a remarkable 10,000:1 contrast ratio. Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones is truly remarkable to view on this TV even in 480p mode which is the best you can get off of a DVD.Nowadays you can pick up a micro fiber cleaning cloth at auto parts stores. When using one of those you can feel the grip of invisible dirt even upon surfaces that look clean. However, I feel no grip at all when dusting this TV, leading me to surmise that the glass surface of this TV has been somehow microscopically perfected. And I am glad to say that little dust seems to be sticking to it.On this TV I can split the digital cable wire and get non-scrambled true HD TV channels directly off the cable wire without even using the HD cable box or the composite or HDMI inputs. For scrambled HD TV, the DVI feed from the HD cable box goes to the TV's HDMI input for true HD and the S-Video feed from the HD cable box goes to the TiVo for non-HD TV. You will be able to record HD programming from your digital HD cable box on your TiVo, only the programs will automatically get changed to 480i non-HD from using the S-Video output connector from your cable box. The HD channels will still look better than normal, however, even after you switch back to your TiVo to see something on an HD channel that you recorded in 480 mode. You will want to be there to watch programs on HD channels live in true HD now, of course, instead of later on as recorded by TiVo.You will find yourself to be ahead of the curve. Your TiVo won't work correctly. Most channels won't be in HD. Your DVD's will all be in the old format. And your cable guy won't have the slightest idea how to actually hook you up to see actual HD, so don't let him or her walk off with the 5 wire red green blue and audio composite video cable you will need!And Eureka, you will know instantly once you actually get true HD on your new TV! Even though there are only a handful of HD stations at present (Discovery HD, ESPN HD, TNT HD, InHD, InHD2, ABC HD, NBC HD, CBS HD and Fox HD and one HD feed for each of the four movie channels) you will find you only want to watch whatever is on in HD instead of whatever you used to watch before. Get ready for a life changing experience, therefore. But let them take a while to get those HD DVD's rolling, so you don't have to replace your entire collection of movies with a new format again so soon after having just changed them all!",

From what I found, there is no other product out there of this quality and image level at this price point. Hats off to Syntax for a great product. The unit performs as good or better than expected based on other reviews I have read. Many bad comments on the remote, but mine works fine from just about any distance, but is a little sensitive to angle. FYI If you have a universal remote, you may not find Syntax codes in the manual, so try the various RCA codes available... one of these should probably work... it did with my SA Cable Set Top Universal Remote.I have not seen the TV operate with and HD input yet. Still anxiously waiting for my cable company to come out and hook me up. The quality on standard Digital Cable is still outstanding, exceeding my expectations, even on an S-video input. I plan to use the DVI-D interface for HD Cable ..... can't wait! DVD's are awesome when using Component inputs (Y Pb Pr). Sound is fine with built in speakers... not great, but more than acceptable. I did not notice the audible noise or humm that others reported.The unit is very sleek and stylish and put together well. It would make a nice addition to anybody's home theater or bedroom, which is where we have ours set up.",

        "review_text": "I'll make this short and sweet. I purchased this Samsung 32\" LCD TV through Amazon for about $1,000. All the local stores had list prices that were several hundred dollars more and Amazon had free shipping and no tax. It was a fantastic deal via Amazon. The TV set is absolutely fantastic.That 4000 to 1 contrast ratio really make the difference between a super picture and a so-so picture. So....folks...when you buy a LCDTV make SURE the contrast ratio is at least 3000 to 1 or better.. This is one of the most important specifications to check when deciding on your HD TV purchase. A low contrast ratio gives you a \"washed out\" picture. Go check a 32\" LCD HDTV (that sell for $600 to $700) and you will see the difference because of the low contrast ratio.Lecture is over :-]I should mention however that I did have some trouble with Amazon's shipper. They were several weeks late getting it to me because, somehow, they had an old, obsolete area code for my telephone number and couldn't get in touch me to set up a shipping time delivery window. So they simply FORGOT about me until I finally called them and started raising cain. It took several telephone calls and e-mails to get things straightened out. Very poor service from Amazon's shipper. How they got a long obsolete area code for my phone is anybody's guess. I didn't give it to them.",

        "review_text": "I want to say first that the actual TV itself is a wonderful piece of electronics. First off the picture quality is incredible. 3D works perfectly and easily for videos designed for 3d and those that aren't. The features of the product are too numerous to mention. It exceeded my expectations in every way. The problem is the AllShare software. It is cumbersome and difficult to use. Refreshing your shared files from your computer takes a very long time and often doesn't work correctly at the end. I find myself refreshing and waiting, refreshing and waiting, etc and finally forced to give up, shut the program down, restart and wait again and then MAYBE it actually refreshes. When it does, finally, refresh then more likely than not it no longer recognizes the TV and must be shut down and restarted again and again until finally and apparently through random chance the TV is again recognized. The troubleshooting and help provided is incomplete or nonexistent. To put it simply I absolutely love the tv, and with equal emotion HATE the software. Please work harder to create a better software solution for what is really a very simple task. Your smartphones are great, maybe ask for some help from the Android software producers to fix this miserable junk AllShare program.",

The TV was dropped in shipping, either from the manufacturer to Amazon or from Amazon to me. The box showed no indication of being dropped. We reboxed the TV, carried it back out and put it back into the delivery van. Called Amazon immediately. Got the run around. Spent about 30 minutes on the phone. Amazon wanted to wait for the TV to return to them, then credit my account and I could buy another TV. Amazon finally said that they would send a replacement for the broke TV. The replacement shipped on 9/12/2007, 5 days after I called. Amazon had to confirm that the shipping company was in possession of the broke TV, so it took until Monday 9/10 for the shipping company to complete the necessary paper work. I received the replacement TV on 9/18 from the same delivery company and delivery man. This time the TV was in perfect shape. As far as the purchase process, Amazon was tolerable and the TV is GREAT, especially on the HD stations. Football, Soccer and Baseball on ESPN HD is incredible.

The border-less frame as been a huge like by all my friends and family. I have actually recommended this TV to several friends all ready. However for the first month I was trying to use the remote and found the reaction time to be slow, and also it felt very awkward using it. I did try to use it for several weeks thinking it might have a learning curve. Voice controls worked fine but felt to me like a gimmick. The touch pad number system was great until you had to dial in a 1000+ number. The remote I replaced with a Logitech harmony remote and all issues on that front are now solved. The smart TV has been awful and i have practically stopped using the features associated with it. I also own an AppleTV which is superior. It seems slow and most of the Favorite channels it thinks I like I never watch. I actually blame the remote for continuously putting in wrong channel numbers. Since i have purchased a new remote i have been happy again with this TV. Other issue has been the set up through a AV receiver but i am working that out and do not believe that the TV is at fault. This TV is absolutely stunning in 1080 and 3D/3D upconvert, and I have already recommended to friends as stated earlier.",

        "review_title": "Fantastic Television", 
        "review_text": "The LNS3251D is simply a fantastic buy at around $1,000. Only a more expensive Sony could possibly best this television.If you're looking for a leading-edge, top of the line TV, this is the one to get. You don't need increased contrast like the higher end Samsungs; this one is deep and dark enough to please even the most critical eyes. Keep in mind that besides adjusting contrast and brightness, this set has an \"E Saving\" mode which will dim the back light considerably. This enhances contrast a GREAT deal. And with the two HDMI inputs, you're set for cable/sat. box with HDMI connectivity and a high-definition DVD player when they're affordable.I used to sell televisions (up to about a year and a half ago) and on my way out I noticed how amazing the Samsung LCDs were becoming. Now, with these current models, they really go toe-to-toe with the Sony Bravia XBR models. And you can't beat that, I'm pretty sure of that. The Samsung is not only the most physically attractive TV but it simply provides the best picture for the size and price point. The piano black is beautiful, the connectivity is perfect, the remote is user-friendly, and the settings are diverse enough to get the picture just the way you'd like it.Amazon also seems to continually have the lowest price on this TV and shipping from Eagle is great. They make sure the screen is not damaged before leaving and they're very polite. That's saying a LOT for any delivery team. I do recommend CALLING them as soon as you track the item as being in your state. You can probably set up delivery for 1-3 days from that point, but if you wait for them to deliver on their own, it will take longer. They seem to prioritize the deliveries setup over the phone.So again, if you're still deciding on a TV, this is the ONE to get. Keep in mind that out of the box, any LCD tv needs some proper adjusting. I've dimmed the back light to the \"medium\" setting and played with the brightness/contrast/color to the point where the pictures look perfect and represent colors properly. You can pick yourself up (or even rent) a calibration DVD to simplify this task.ONE con about this TV is the sound, as many others have mentioned. It is poor. Very poor. I have it hooked up to a surround sound system in my bedroom anyway, so if you're planning on using the TV's speakers, don't be surprised by the muffled sound. Samsung still hasn't gotten that right yet, but I don't care about that - the picture is perfect.",

        "review_text": "I have had this TV for about 6 months now, and I have been very happy with it. My only complaint would be that to change sources you have to cycle through all of them. There is a way to select them through the main menu, but it takes you just as long to get to that menu as it does to cycle through them.I thought glare would be an issue since it is installed in a room with a patio door, but I rarely notice the glare. The glare is significantly less noticeable than the CRT it replaced. The CRT used to drive me crazy. I think the flat screen coupled with a tilting wall mount is a big reason for the difference.Sometimes it seems to have a slightly greenish tint to the picture, but I think that is mostly associated with the source. I only notice it every now and then.I do worry sometimes about burn-in, but I have not had any issues yet. I don't treat it very special (watch shows in letterbox & with side bars regularly), but I am conscious about not over-doing it and I try to vary things. I would say I'm only slightly more careful than I was with the CRT.Overall, I'm glad I did not buy an LCD instead.

But for the price and the fact that this TV has an LED engine not a bulb pushes it ahead. This television has every option you can need and looks great. At this point I only have basic cable, not even digital cable, however it has a built in HD digital tuner, so I am watching 1080i broadcast in HD, and I have a very good, but not HD dvd play which looks amazing as well. Once the satilite with HD programing comes and with the use of the HDMI/DVI cable I am expecting even better picture. Now looking for the correct DVD player to get 1080p picture. Amazon was great from start to finish, the white glove delivery was including in the price as well. This same model, and make sure when you go shopping for price that you are looking at the same model, there are a few with close model numbers but are not LED, was $2599.00 at the local store plus tax, plus delivery, which you would want, even if you have a truck, if you damage it while bringing it home its on your tab. I paid almost a grand less, total including setting on my stand and the driver stays until you make sure it works. This is the TV to buy. I could not be happier.",

The picture is adjustable from 16:9 to 4:3 and to two different zooms. It has a digital antenna tuner as well as a cable input so you can have an antenna and a cable box hooked up at the same time. It has three HDMI inputs etc. The delivery service took about a week and a half and the they carried the TV inside, took it out of the box, and turned it on to make sure it worked.

Amazon said they shipped it on October 9, and it would be delivered by Eagle USA freight service on October 18. I received a phone call from Eagle USA that the television would be delivered on October 16. The driver called that he would be late, but he did arrive at a reasonable time. He removed my old one, unpacked the new television, installed my new one and hooked it up. Terrific. You can't ask for more than that. The picture is terrific and color is dynamic. It is as good as everybody said it was, and I am happy with my purchase, including the service by Amazon.com. Also, the price was $200 cheaper with free shipping and no sales tax compared to any local purchase, even though, Amazon.com seem to be increasing the price weekly. This was a good buy.",

        "review_text": "To be honest, I don't have this exact product. I have it's 'twin', the Syntax Kolin DLT-2711M. A few weeks shy of two years of ownership, the television died, for lack of a better word. At that point, the power off LED would not be lit but the television would not be on and I could not turn it on. Unplugging the television for a time served as a temporary fix, but now the tv is out completely. My suspicion is that it's a bad power supply (while it didn't solve the problem, I noticed upon inspection that the AC socket 'legs' had broken from the PS and needed to be re-soldered).I've noticed other reviews with a similar problem - the blue/black screen of death. A Yahoo group devoted to Syntax LCDs has solved that problem if you're interested. While not the same issue I have, they both stem from cheap construction - substandard components and shoddy manufacturing.That being said, the television performed adequately while it worked and was rather inexpensive. In fact, Syntax-Brillian has continued to market budget-conscious LCD TVs with some success. Ultimately, you get what you pay for and that includes customer service (however, Syntax's tech support is reportedly more helpful if you actually get through to them). I think next time I'll buy from a more reputable manufacturer.Caveat emptor.",

Shipping was a pain, as I did free shipping and it took about 2-3 weeks to get it and then I had to take off work to get it delivered but Eagle was held up at a prison due to a random search that took a long time so they missed the 4 hour window and delivered it that night. The person who sets up the delivery gives you a phone number for you to get a hold of them, but it just goes to a machine and they call you back hours later. I had to look for info online and get amazon to call the delivery truck to set up a new time since they missed the delivery window. Very, very inconvenient.I haven't yet calibrated it, but looking online, I've found avsforum.com to be a very good source of info on calibration and problems associated with these sets and others.http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=847465You can also try this for calibration:http://www.hometheatermag.com/advicefromtheexperts/407cali/I have the tv mounted above my fireplace (looks nice) with the cords running through the wall out to the entertainment center (12 foot length minimum) so they aren't visible. I was originally going to run everything through a receiver and one cord to the tv but after reading up some more on the tv I found that it can control most of what I need (dvd player, cable box, vcr, etc) through the remote that comes with the tv. So all I need are long cables to make it to the receiver so I can watch my movies through 5.1 surround sound.You don't need expensive hdmi cables, they're digital and only transmit 0s and 1s so if $10 cables give you a picture, you can be sure the $95 monster cables will give you the exact same picture. That is unless you get into the hdmi version 1.3 or above (1.3a, 1.3b).check here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HdmiYou also don't need to get a hdtv antenna, just a regular old antenna or rabbit ears will work fine, I actually am not using anything for an antenna but can still pick up local hd stations over the air.I chose this one over the lnt4665f due to the screen reflection differences and the windows i have in my room. The real only notable difference is the contrast ratio being only 10000:1 versus 15000:1 on the 4665. That's due to the glass screen itself.Also remember to keep checking back on the price from day to day during the initial 30 day period of ordering it, I saved $80 just by seeing the price dropping and emailing customer service about it.",

At first, I was hesistant about this tv, since I've read tons of issues about this model. However, for the price of $1200 (price matched by sears, can you believe it?), the decision was too easy for me not to turn down a deal like this. I hooked up my PS3 right away, and was completely blown away. It performed very well. Colors are very accurate although, the blacks can be improved. The one prob that I can point out though, is the blinking problem. This only occur when you use an hdmi. Audio/Sound is pretty lame, but most people buy home theatre system anyways so that would help a ton. I was really impressed with the 4061. Hooked up the upconvert DVD player using 720p still is jaw dropping. HD channels makes you don't want to watch reg channels. Non HD channels are very blurry with this tv. But I only watch HD's so that doesn't bother me.",

Bottom line is that a larger percentage of the LCD and plasma end up sitting on something, not hung on a wall. Samsung has got projection depth down to under 15\" and delivers a picture that is every bit as good if not better than LCD or plasma. I have a wall unit that is 60\" wide and 17\" deep. This TV fits with about 2 1/2\" on each side and is recessed from the front by over 2\", looks almost built in and several people have made that comment.I wanted \"big\" and didn't want to spend a huge amount of money. The sound is adaquate but with the money I saved over the other types (at least $3,500) I can afford a really nifty system.

I mainly bought it over a plasma because no burn in when playing video games for my kids, and the led technology takes the worry out of projection like you have with the bulb/wheel dlp setup. The speaker system is not near as good as my old Toshiba Cinema Series rear projection tv, but it is okay for normal viewing. For movies everybody including me uses a theater surround sound system anyway, but I do view alot of tv at night with the sound provided by the tv, and bass is sadly lacking.I did not have any of the halo effect with this one, and I am pretty sure with the ones Amazon sells that end in SAX, Samsung has fixed this problem.I have noticed though that you still get a ghosting effect in the center of the screen from top to bottom. It is simply caused by any reflection in your room, whether it be a ceiling light above, or in my case a light reflection off the hardwood floor from a nearby window. When the set is on and a picture is present, you don't notice it, but if the screen goes dark or black for a second you can see it. I try to watch with low lights and the blinds closed during the day.I had a Samsung rep. out to verify the above mentioned ghosting was not in fact the halo effect others have experienced, and while he was out he made several adjustments to help with incorrect screen geometry, centering of the picture, and focus. I now know how to do those things myself because I saw him do it, so that is nice in case I need to change anything minor later.As for picture adjustment, the standard, movie, or dynamic settings as they come default are not right at all in my opinion. I fought with it for about a week, and broke down and bought Digital Video Essentials to help me calibrate the picture. I think it looks great now, and I am sure a Pro calibration might look a little better, but I am happy with mine the way I did it, and saved $300 to $500 to get it done professionally.Overall, happy so far.The only thing left to do is buy an extended warranty, and you have to do it before 90 days from the end of your standard 1 year warranty or it's too late.",

        "review_text": "Bought this TV in October 2007 (from Amazon)after spending that summer doing all kinds of research (especially Plasma vs LCD comparisons) I choose to with this Samsung/Plasma due mostly to its competitive pricing, picture quality and standard features. I LCD's at the time were still behind the Plasmas with picture quality. I originally wanted a 42\" but went bigger and I am so glad I did.Now lets get down to what you are reading this review for. Once purchased it took about a week for delivery (which for me was way too long but I did have time to find a TV stand). If you are going from a SD TV to a HD TV (as I did) then you will be amazed at the picture quality especially if you are a sports fan. Now SD channels are not that good but are better that a regular TV with 4:3 pull down. Also I switched from Comcast to DirectTV due to the picture quality. Comcast has to use a video compression technique to get HD over the coaixal cable which henders quality.Out of the box I had a low sounding buzzing noise that was intermittent and if I turned the volume up I wouldn't hear it. It kinda bothered me at first but I go over it. After reading some forums alot of people experince this with Plasma it's just to what volume level can you tolerate it. Samsung is aware and have some remedies. Also be aware this TV gets hot and expands the plastic molding which will make a crakling sound from time to time (you will also hear this when you turn the TV off). This issue/concern is addressed in the owners manual. This is just a by product of having a Plasma TV.After adjusting all the available picture settings I was completely satisfied with picture quality. I have a PS3 (HDMI) and XBOX 360 (Component) and both are beautiful to look at. Please be advised that additional adjustments may be neccessary to get the picture the way you want it. I could write more on this but its my vision vs yours. So remember its what you prefer not me. I am just very pleased with the HD and SD picture quality. I highly recommend this TV.I do have to say I do get compliments from others (mostly friends and family) on the picture quality they see on this TV.Now I did have a bit problem that drove me crazy for awhile. Late January 09 I started noticing this rapid pixel flicker of red and green color in dark areas of video content. It only seemed to happen after the TV had been on for awhile (sometimes 30min to 2hrs). I think is was tempeature related. Oh by the way the backt top of the TV gets really hot. So if you have children please be aware of this. Now back to this flickering of pixels you had to be about 3-5 feet away to really see it but after about a month of this I could see it from my standard sitting distance (which is exactly 10ft).I called Samsung support and even after a year still issued a warranty work order. The tech that came out could see it (that was good to know because my girlfriend said I was obessed with this. Unfortunately the tech just oredered a power supply board and that realy didn't fix it. So I called Samsung back and they issued another warranty claim and the TV repair shop said we will get you an interior display replacement (which replaces the display and all boards except power supply and input/output board.). So needless to say Samsung support has been GREAT to me.Overall--- Do your own research. Pick the TV that fits your budget and wants. You already know you need a TV. Don't be afraid to go big. Go online to the actual brand manfacturer to determine what the models are (entry level vs premium) and features they come with. Then go to the big retailers to actually see the TV. Do be skeptical of picture quality in the store. They use different settings than what you may use in your home. Remeber where you are putting this TV (pay attention to you surrounding light). Then shop Amazon becuase no sales tax. I would've paid over 1,000 more if I bought at the BB store. Also not every TV is perfect these are highly technical pieces of equipment and all brands have issues (as you will discover when you do your research). Its how they deal with those issues that sets them apart. As I have stated before Samsung has been great to me.Hope this review helped you in making an informed decission.",

The price for the unit was far below Sears or other Electronic Stores in the area, a real value. Hooked the unit up to local HD Cable Service, great picture with very few adjustments needed. The picture is much brighter than a DLP of the same size and the Black Contrast is outstanding, an initial worry about buying a LCD over Plasma. The unit is in a room with floor to almost ceiling windows in the background, there is no problem with light reflection,even during mid day.Overall, I would highly recommend the unit and Amazon is the place to buy it.",

        "review_text": "I recently purchased this item from Amazon and have no complaints about the TV. It is beutiful and operated flawlessly as expected. I have rated it 5/5.I am writing this review to warn potential buyers of the problems with Eagle Delivery service that Amazon utilizes. The service is advertised as \"white glove\" This includes delivery to your home, uncrating, setup and removal of packing materials. Amazon sent the unit out in less than 48 hours. The tracking service said it had arrived in Denver (the local hub 2 days latter.) There it sat for 4-5 days with me anticipating a call to arrange delivery. No call!! Eventually, through forums I was able to contact Eagle. First they said they had tried to contact us (We received no such call an the answering machine had no message) Then they said they would arrange the delivery in 1-2 days. Still OK we were excited. On the delivery day we received a call from the driver of the delivery truck inquiring if we were home and did we have someone to help him with the TV since he was alone. After several calls to Eagle (No answer and a hang up on hold for the \"right person\") I gave up. In the mean time the delivery man had found an assistant and they delivered it to the house. When asked about setup they replied \"We don't do that, if something went wrong we would be blamed. We plugged in the TV and it seemed OK and they left.The TV is great, but watch yourself during the delivery process. I think the TV would still be in Denver if we were not pro-active. Shame on you Amazon for not monitoring this better.",

Why?? I read the articles that talked about the amount of space you will sit from the TV should predicate the size of the TV you purchase. The logic seemed good to me until I visited some furniture stores with mock up living rooms that featured \"real\" televisions playing movies. After sitting in these mock living room arrangements and realizing that my living room was just a bit bigger (my TV is 8ft from my couch) and yet I still enjoyed the view of their 52\" I decided to go ahead and but this TV despite the math. So, to all of you considering the advice of mathematicians I say hogwash! Go to a furniture store near you equipped like mine was and view for yourself. After all, think about the movie theater...I would like to seem them justify their math with that!Cheers!David",

I was cringing so I helped him carry it in. After we dragged the dirty box on my carpet we unboxed it, and dropped it on the stand. I had to convince him to stay while I hooked it up.

Eagle delivered it with two guys who carried the TV into my house, unboxed it, and let me power it up to make sure it worked then removed all of the packing material. It was better than going down to Best Buy or Circuit City and picking one up myself. The box itself didn't have any scuff marks or anything. I'd actually trust Eagle more than I would a retailer.

I have Time warner cable with the HD package hooked up with HDMI cable. You will hate watching the basic channels though, as the 61 inch screen really brings out how bad the quality is. I hooked up my laptop with an s-video cable, and my pictures look pretty good. I only have a 3.1 megapixel camera, so I bet they would look excellent with the higher resolution camera's. My basic DVD player is hooked up with digital coax, and looks great. It has an extra HDMI input for a Blueray or HD player. The service from Amazon was fantastic. The shipping company brought it in the house and set it on the stand, and it arrived 5 days sooner than promised! The price went down $60 3 weeks after I bought it, and Amazon gave a credit back. No Shipping, and no Tax, how can you beat Amazon?",

        "review_text": "My kids received a PS3 for Christmas; therefore, I was thrown into the HDTV market. The kids insisted that I buy a 1080P TV. I tried to save a few hundred dollars and bought a Sceptre 42\" 1080P and a Vizio 47\" 1080P HDTV. I was not completely satisfied with my two purchases. I bought the Sony KDL-40V2500 40\" a few days ago. Everyone in the family (including myself) are stunned by the amazing picture on this TV through Dish Network HD channels, PS3 blu-ray discs, and PS3 games. Standard TV and standard DVDs look really good too. I believe it's worth spending a few more bucks to get a superior product.I'm somewhat concerned over the cloud issues found on the web. I spoke to Sony today. They acknowledged the cloud issue with the Sony XBR HDTVs over the phone and their Sony website. However, they said the Sony KDL-40V2500 does not have a cloud issue. I do have some uneven backlight when the screen is black on blank. It doesn't seem to affect the picture quality. I don't want to return this TV if this should not be a concern.

Amazon won't let me change the number of stars I gave, but I'd certainly give the set itself five stars.",

Everything looks amazing, especially once you get some good custom picture settings going.My only complaint (and what keeps this from getting 5 stars) are the speakers. Compared to my 32\" model they sound very hollow and tinny. But I think I've found a setting I can live with, or I'm just getting used to it.Overall, if you can get this from Amazon and not one of their secondary sellers I highly recommend it. They have the best price and free shipping. The delivery guy was extremely nice and helped carry the TV in. The box had no damage whatsoever on it. Couldn't be more pleased with this service.",

We bought ours towards the end of this models run and for the deal we got (which meant getting a 52\" instead of a 46\" for the same price or actually less) I couldn't see a better 1080p 60 Hz HDTV out there. I studied the 65 against the 120Hz 71 model and the Sony Bravias and there was absolutely nothing that could justify the extra money except that the bezels on this era and model of Samsungs left a bit to be desired compared to the Bravia as far as quality. The newer 550, 650 and 750 series Samsungs have in my opinion much improved bezels. However, that rather cheap plastic black bezel isn't what you watch and unless I pay a lot of attention to it it's really hard to find anything wrong. It's operated flawlessly since removed from the box and set up. If you are happy with something that doesn't have quite all the bells and whistles of the newer Samsung replacements and at the much cheaper price these are bringing now I wouldn't pass it up however they're getting difficult to find now.",

The HD programming will blow you away. You can see the pores in peoples skin and the tiny little sparkle in their eyes. Its great! I don't know why some say the internal surround sound speakers are tinny sounding. I have found that with proper adjustments on the audio menu, you can get a very acceptable sound from the internal speakers. Make no mistake, my Bose surround system which is an add on sound much better than the internal speakers, but for average broadcasting the internal sound is very acceptable to my listening tastes. If you prefer more dramatic audio, invest in a Bose Surround system, expecially for watching a movie.Menu adjustments are pretty easy to understand and simple to make minor changes to your individual tastes following very understandable menu items. I am still getting after 6 weeks an odor of heated plastic from I guess the newness of the TV. At least I think that's what the odor is from. top and back of the screen seems to get pretty warm to the touch while the system is on. I thind that's pretty common. Overall, I would highly recommend this flat screen HD to anyone looking for a good buy and a quality HD LCD TV.",

        "review_text": "I bought this TV in Early March and have had it for about 2 months. I have been 110% happy with it. This is my first HDTV so I was careful about which one to buy. I use almost every input on the tv. I have my Xbox 360 and PS3 and HD cable box hooked up via HDMI. Some of you may think how i have 3 HDMI sources hooked into two on the TV, my sound system has a splitter built in. I have my computer hooked up via VGA though I have stoped using it because 1080p is such high eez the text although clear was small from 8 ft away. I have my Wii DVD player hooked up via component. I do own the HD dvd add on for my Xbox 360 and it is amazing picture quality. I also have Blu-ray as it is built in to the PS3. In my opinion the HD DVD looks better as it uses VC-1 for most of its movies. While Ble-ray uses some unfinished Java and there for in some scenes there is a grainy look. It has gotten much better with newer movies such as Night at the Museum. I always buy a movie on HD DVD if I can. Now back to the TV, SD is okay but i don't really watch it other than Daily Show & Colbert Report. HD looks stunning and UI have no complain on the black levels. 6000:1 is great although 10000:1 is what I would have liked but is too expensive on an LCD. The Piano finish looks great and classy. I can not watch anything with the built in speakers as I am used to a 5.1 system and recommend getting something for audio. Games look great in HD but the Wii is not meant for any HD let alone a 1080p TV. Does not really matter i hardly use it as it is. The 360 doubles as an up-convert DVD player. I just watched Lost season one and two as well as the first season of Rome on DVD and it looked amazing on this HDTV, you may even think of them as HD releases.I am totally happy with this HDTV in more ways than I can count. I highly recommend it and believe it is the best 1080p 40\" TV on the market as of writing.",

        "review_text": "We traded in our 1996 35\" CRT for this TV. Not only is the picture fantastic, the Anynet HDMI control makes it very, very easy to use. Turn on the TV and the surround sound system turns itself on, uses the Audio Return Channel feature for sound, turns off the TV internal speakers and sets itself up. The TV remote volume now controls the surround sound system without having to put in any codes or punch any extra buttons; it just works. Put a DVD into my PS3 and the TV automatically switches to the appropriate input and displays the DVD. And the TV remote now controls the PS3 without having to input any codes or punch any extra buttons; it just works. The TV was extremely easy to set up with our cable TV DVR and the TV remote runs it fine. A few things that would make it nicer is that the TV remote turns the cable box off when the TV turns off but will not turn the cable box on when the TV is turned on. There is a button on the TV remote to turn on the cable box but it caused my wife some frustration because she knew she had not turned it off. It would be nice if the STB (set-top box) turned on when the TV turns on, just like it turns off when the TV turns off. Or just leave the STB on as our old TV did. Also, the Guide button on the touch remote always starts at Channel 2 regardless of what channel you're watching. You have to go through several moves on the touch remote to get to the \"STB Guide\" (set-top box). There should be an option to allow the Guide button on the touch remote to default to the STB Guide. We use Skype with our kids away at college.

Buying from a 'brick and mortar' store means I have to pay tax and get a truck and haul the thing myself to my home,forget that. A day after I bought it the price came down 250. I called and they said that they would give me the lower price, and if it came down more within the month they would give me that price also,,can't beat that..

Some friends kept telling us that we wouldn't be happy if our TV wasn't LCD or plasma, but so far this one proves them wrong. We wanted a larger TV for a better price, and got it. We had no problems with the delivery, as I know a few others did. Ours is in a basement corner, so we don't notice any viewing angle distortion or glare unless we're almost directly to the immediate left or right of the TV. Consumers report mentioned it having a problem with the rainbow effect, but none of us have ever noticed anything. It is a better TV for a big room (ours was 18 by 20 ft) - if you're too close, it does bother your eyes. I did get an extended warranty on it just to be safe because I'm not sure how the led engine light system will hold up over time. I was able to extend the warranty 3 more years through visa for a much better price than the company. If you're in the market for a big TV, and don't want to pay $6000, I'd say go for it!",

The PQ rivals expensive Sony sets, and I much prefer the look of these to those other brands. The only \"issue\" I have with the TV is the lack of overscan control over HDMI ... when using the PC over HDMI, it clips an inch or so around the border, making it difficult to recover maximized windows or even use the Start bar. There is probably a firmware update available for this, and if so, I would definitely give this thing 5 stars. There is no overscan over VGA though, so I can live with an analog PC connection for now.

        "review_text": "This is what I wrote in my previous review:Bought my Samsung HL-T6187S on 9/23/2007. I was hesitant with buying such a big size and ticket item online. However, Amazon was great, for both delivery, punctuality, and price. I came from a 15 year old 32\" CRT TV so this was my treat. What can I say, I hold on to my stuff until they are sooooo obsolete or broken. Eagle was great for delivering the product unscathed. Turned on the TV and my eyes were as giddy as a school boy. The picture was great. Over the Hedge and Star Wars 1080p looked sooooo wonderful. Even the built in TV speakers with SRS turned on is pretty good, for built in TV speakers. Wonderful array of inputs and outputs. It was surprisingly light. The cabinets do feel a slightly flimsy.But, hey, I guess this is what I get for getting technology not fully matured. I too got the halo prism and this ))))))))(((((((( effect. Also one dead pixel. Let me expand.I have one dead black pixel. I understand that is inherent in the manufacturing process. Much like LCD monitors. It even says so in the Warranty disclaimer. No biggie because I have to be watching a bright white scene and be at less than a foot from the screen and really look for it. At 8 feet or more you cannot see it. Ho humm. I still say the disclaimer that a consumer must accept a few dead pixels due to manufacturing limitations and cannot return the product is unacceptable. The consumer must accept a less than perfect product but good enough is unacceptable. I guess I along with the masses have accepted this. Luckily, I still love Samsung and I got their SyncMaster(tm) 226BW 22\" widescreen display with no flaws. Lovely product. That's why I'm sticking with Samsung. Great prices for a great product.So on the ))))))))(((((((( effect. Like the dead pixel I have to be actually less than 6\", viewing a bright white background, and at an extreme side angle to see it. At the suggested greater than 8 feet viewing distance this is not noticeable. No problem with that.The biggest complaint I have is the halo prism defect. This is easily producible like the other posters indicated. The senate scene in 300. Where you have the white sky and pillar background and Queen Gorgo is standing and providing a dark foreground. It can also be easily produced via a PC. Put a dark screen in the bottom half with the rest of the screen white. I did it by having an MS-DOS screen in the bottom center half with Windows Explorer in the background.I'm calling Samsung to get this fixed.So after being pulled around by the Samsung techs I'm on my second TV. Thankfully, Amazon is such a a great online company that the exchange was no hassle and I went without a TV uninterrupted.Well, this second set still had the halo prism problem but less intense. No dead pixels. However, the screen looked like it had dust behind the screen. Now this one has a geometry problem on the top. the ))))(((( is actually more intense now. On top of that, the screen doesn't seem to be securely attached to the screen!!! Samsung needs to get their manufacturing act together. Second tech call!Update on 11/28/2007...After the second set had the same problems but more defects, I jumped ship and bought a Sony KDS-60A3000. Very nice TV.",

We have personally been very pleased with Amazon service, people we talked to and the product itself--FANTASTIC TELEVISION--BRILLIANT COLOR--WE HAVE A MOVIE CINEMA SET UP IN OUR DEN WITH OUR NEW TELEVISION. We have never done business prior to this with Amazon--always a little nervous whether to order on line. Very pleased with the service--would not hesitate to do business with Amazon again. Our daughter also ordered from Amazon a blue ray by Samsung for us as a gift. It is a compliment to our new television.The color is brilliant--I personally think it looks even better than the Plasma tvs--I am so glad I waited until these new models came out...The best price for the best TV and really happy with it!!!!!!!!!!!",

        "review_text": "I bought the Samsung LNT5265F when it first came out in May or June of 2007 for the insane price of $4600 from Sears. The TV was brand new and it was one of the first LCD's to have 1080p technology. I also bought a $500 warranty from Sears to increase the warranty to 2012. The price dropped more then $2500 with in 6 months of my purchase. As of 3/2010 I realized I can no longer wide fit any station or channel unless it is in HD and already broadcasting in this format. Prior to this I was able to make any movie or station fit the screen. When Sears came out to look at the TV they decided it maybe a software problem they checked it and said the software I have is the latest version. The software by the way is dated Oct 07. They then decided to switch out the main board in the TV. Unfortunately this did absolutely nothing. They are now trying to tell me that my TV was never able to wide fit stations or movies that aren't broadcasting in that format. The TV has an option that says Wide fit which I've used successfully for almost 3 years. Now the option while still there no longer lights up or allows you to click on it. Anyone else have this problem or was my TV magical and operating above and beyond the capabilities intended by Samsung?",

        "review_text": "Let me first start by saying that before this TV I had a 23\" Sanyo HDTV. The size difference is incredible (when I first got the TV it was so much clearer and bigger that I actually got a sense of being dizzy while playing FPS's on it). The display is very very crisp and clear. I can honestly say this is one of the best looking displays I have ever seen. The new screens that Samsung is using in their LCD HDTVs is a great improvement (it has a slightly glossier look to it than conventional LCD's, giving it a cleaner and brighter look, without being too shiny like some Plasmas can be). The only negative I can think of for this TV is that it took a while to get the settings just right to get the best image. But once you do it really is the best image you can get for the price. Samsung is known for being top quality on their HDTVs, and this one is no exception. I can honestly say I would most definately recommend this set to anyone who is looking at TVs in this size/price range.",

The picture was great and for the first couple of years all was well. During that time and based on the excellent picture and no problems occuring we purchase a second 61DLP for our downstairs game room. Not long after the second purchase the lamp in the first set went out. I called support and was told the lamp was not covered in the warranty, so we spent $179.00 and installed it ourselves. All went well for another 2 plus years then the set went out again. This time a technician came to the house and informed us that the \"engine\" needed to be replaced. Luckily we had bought the extended 5 year warranty (for $450) and we were still in the warranty period (by 2 months). He replaced the engine with a rebuilt one, can you believe it after spending $450 on a warrantywe got a rebuilt part. But it worked and we were happy again. Only one year later the set went out again and after buying another lamp (which we could not return) we were told by the Samsung technician it wasn't the lamp and the TV for all prctical purposes was dead. My upset is with the fact I spent $4,971.91 for the latest technological set and only got 6 years use out of it, a cost of over $800 per year. But we had the second set and moved it into our living room about 6 months ago. It has seen little use in the game room and had very few hours on it. I thought we would be good for another few years. Nope, today the lamp popped and the tv quit. Is it only the lamp? or is it something else? who knows, we will have to call the Samsung tech people and start all over again. Or we just may scrap the set and go buy a GOOD tv, anyone help us on that one. Two Samsung 61DLP's $7,000 invested and no tv to watch. Never Again!",

And man is it!I work for a major cable company, and hooked this bad boy up to my hd dvr, through hdmi, and the picture looks crystal clear! but what i was most amazed at is how good regular television looks as well, this tv does a good job of smothing out the artifacts of standard television. But by far the absolute best use of this tv, is the fact that it is a computer monitor as well. Sitting on my couch with a wireless keyboard and mouse and browsing the internet is awsome. The last thing i have to say about this tv is that it does well in day light, I remember my grandparents used to have an old projection tv back in the day and if there was any light in the room the tv would be completely faded. Not with this tv, i can watch it perfect with my living room blinds open and it looks as good as it does with them closed. This is an excelent tv which blows away any other competition in its price range.",

        "review_text": "Eagle GL shipped my package. Package looked like it was handled properly, and they called me on time to deliver the package. However, i elected to pick it up Friday instead of having them deliver it Monday (they dont do weekends, dont ask me why). I was not very impressed with them when picking up the package. The lady at the desk did not even know how to let me sign for it! But package was unharmed, free dilvery by amazon.Other notes:4065 has a glass finish on it, which makes colors more vibrant and more realistic. However, for some people it may cause glare. I have had no glares problems when using proper lighting. One note with pixilation, happens on all LCDs. I have only noticed it a few times, on closeups on fast moving objects. One reason why I chose this tv, over the 4665 or any larger LCD, is the pixilation and ghosting become more apparent on larger screens with the same refresh rate. But like I said, practically none on this one and its smaller size of 40\".Conclusion:Overall, a TV needs to have great Picture Quality, and this one has the best I have seen with tvs 40\" and up.",

        "review_text": "I just had this LCD delivered tonight and wanted to share my experience with ordering through Amazon. I was nervous about buying such an expensive LCD online, but I am very happy. The TV was shipped and delivered exactly when Amazon promised. The freight shipping company was Eagle USA; I read multiple posts on AVS forum commenting that this was a good company and I have to agree. I tracked the order online and it showed it arrived in my city Friday morning. By early Friday afternoon they called to schedule a delivery time. They showed up during the four hour delivery window as promised, brought the TV to my unit, helped me unpack it and allowed me to hook it up to my cable box to make sure it worked before I signed for it. Overall, I could not have asked for better service from either Amazon or Eagle USA, and am glad I chose to purchase through the site at a savings of almost $1,000.As for the TV, the HD picture quality is AMAZING! I've only watched it for a few hours now so won't comment in too much depth, but so far I've experienced no problems with the TV.I love this TV and am very happy I decided to finally make the purchase!",

        "review_text": "I purchased the Samsung LN-T5265F LCD HDTV recently, price was great through Amazon, no other B&M; stores could come close to their price.Pros:-Black is superb, which was the #1 Most impressive thing about this TV-Color is great, takes some calibration from the default settings though-Lots of inputs 3xHDMI, VGA (PC) etc....-Contrast is amazing, its absolutely stunning to see something white on a black background.Cons:-Left & Right sides of the TV are brighter (not clouds, but brighter pillars) but it is not consistent, only some content makes it noticeable. Dark movies through HDMI on my PC it was very noticeable, but on HDMI HD-DVR it's not as noticible.-Slow input change, switching between HDMI inputs was slow, and there is no direct input buttons on the remote.-Unit makes some \"creaking\" clicks/noises when you turn it on and off for about a min or two, (ie. like your car when its cooling off) it's not very loud, and doesn't bother me that much.Anyway, it's a fantastic LCD HDTV. Every time I sit down to watch it I marvel and how great the contrast and the colors are. Also using my PC @ 1080p (1920x1080) resolution is amazingly clear!This is a great TV, that I would recommend to almost anyone, except those that are very picky like me about the very faint brighter left/right sides of the screen (only in certain conditions).I have also returned this TV due to the fact that I can't stand the brighter left/right sides, I couldn't live with this. I have since purchased a LN-T5271f, which doesn't have this issue and is well worth the extra 4-5 hundred extra for the advanced features and even better contrast.",

Works great as a PC display, great for gaming, and the digital TV tuner pulls in all the over the air channels A-OK. As a bonus, you can plug in a USB flash drive and play music / videos / photos with common PC files - no fancy conversion required like with Apple products. The only con is the the TV stand, it provides no tilt support which would be nice when using as a PC display. There are some display settings that can be used to compensate for no tilt, but a nicer stand would be better. There is mounting support (4 screw holes) on the back, so I'm considering attaching it to the wall with a bracket with tilt support.",

        "review_text": "When the tv was working, I generally liked it purely because of its size and price. Getting a good brightness and color setting for the screen is challenging. There is a very narrow range of view angles for optimal quality - directly in front of the screen and near eye-level. Otherwise, the picture is dim. It's frustrating to see such a big difference just from standing versus sitting in the same spot. I haven't had any other DLPs to compare this to.I can't comment on HD. SD is acceptable for normal programming, although I'm sure HD would look snazzy. Sports can be frustrating to watch at this size in SD, though.The #1 problem with mine is that the volume spontaneously goes all the way up to 100, and unplugging the set for several minutes is the only solution. This happened within an hour of getting it off the truck, but then didn't happen again for maybe a month. After it had happened a few times, I called Samsung for repairs. After 2.5 weeks in the shop, it just came back today - worse than before. I had it on for ~15 minutes at a time, then the volume cranked up and it had to be unplugged for several minutes. So for now, its only use is as a big expensive digital photo viewer.It's probably a bad sign that while this tv was in the shop for two and a half weeks, I really didn't miss it.",

        "review_text": "I've had this TV for nearly a year. It's excellent with 1080i signal via HDMI from an upscaling DVD player. The picture is beautiful, the sound is not bad, especially for such a compact design (the speaker is beneath the screen). Compared to the competition at the time we bought this the value was absolutely superb. I also run 1080i signals via HDMI from my AppleTV box, and that also works great.The one problem I have just run into is when playing back 1080p signals from my new PS3 via HDMI, the picture eventually cuts out, and then the TV will pretty much refuse to display anything from the game console.I exchanged my PS3 under warranty and it made no difference. I don't know if this is a one-off problem with my unit, or if it's a design flaw. I've been unable to find any reports of this, hence my motivation for posting. I'm going to try the PS3 using a component video cable instead. If that works then I'll be satisfied (the difference between 1080i and 1080p will not be a dealbreaker for me on a 40\" TV, it might be more significant on the larger models).",

        "review_title": "Best TV I ever bought", 
        "review_text": "I bought this television new back on 3/20/07. I was finishing my basement and needed something big enough to fill the space yet light enough to get down a steep flight of stairs. At the time I had a 57\" Toshiba RPTV that while a great tv, was to heavy and awkward to get down the stairs. So I sold it and bought the Samsung.Delivery was amazing. I think it was originally slated to take 12-14 days, I got a call 3 days after I ordered it from the shipping company saying they had it, would be in the area, and did I want it early? I was amazed that not only was delivery free, it only took 3 days.As for the TV set, blown away would be the best word to use. While I don't have an HD-DVD or Blu-Ray player (yet) it made my progressive scan DVD player show a movie like never before. The first movie we watched was the new James Bond flick and after the opening chase scene, I told my fiance that I don't think I'll ever go into a movie theater again, I was that impressed. Since that day, I've hooked up my PS2 game system as well as my PC. It is great to have a TV that everyone can enjoy, as well as the option for a 61\" PC monitor for online gaming, web surfing and working from home.If you are on the fence about buying this TV, don't wait, just do it. You will not regret this purchase.",

        "review_title": "Samsung DLP = Best Quality for your Large Screen HDTV Dollar", 
        "review_text": "I've been planning on purchasing a large screen HDTV for at least two years now and with the recent price cuts in HDTVs I decided to take the plunge. I started off by researching the competing technologies and specifications that define HDTV. Next, I moved on to visiting local retailers to see how HDTVs from different manufacturers compared to each other. I primarily kept my eye on Samsung, Sony, JVC, and Mitsubishi. I looked at Sony due to their reputation for high quality displays (WEGA, XBR). Mitsubishi was investigated because one of my friends who owns a Mitsubishi HDTV. JVC was looked at primarily because the price points and features closely matched Samsung's. The Samsung had the best picture of all units I viewed at the local retailers. Amazon won my hard earned dollars due to their excellent Super Saver shipping and their price point which was more than $300 less than the lowest price offered by a local retailer. Factor in local taxes, and delivery charges and my savings mounted to more than $500.The Samsung picture is stunning. Standard DVDs look very good in 4:3 mode or if they are properly formatted for widescreen, 16:9 mode. The TV has a wealth of customization features that allow tailoring of tint be each of the primary colors plus two additional colors in their 5-color gamut. Presets for different color styles simplify changing the color temperatures. A static high-quality, color rich image is present in the setup screen to view existing settings side by side with changes applied. Additonally, Samsung has viewing themes (e.g. Standard, Movie, Vivid) that changing color, contrast, and brightness characteristics. Lastly, Samsung includes a feature called DNIe that appplies a high-quality sharpening filter to the picture. The feature does as promised but can definitely reveal limitations in the image source that would have been missed with the feature disabled. You can preview DNIe via a split screen that shows the picture with and without the DNIe applied. I have not used the built-in audio capabilities of the TV so I cannot comment on the audio quality.The Samsung chassis is very elegant and the screen bezel is a piano-lacquer black. The unit only weighs approx. 80 lbs. and has a surprisingly small footprint.Shipping for me was handled by EGL out of Ohio. The unit arrived well ahead of time and the delivery quality was mediocre. The delivery truck arrived with only one employee and I had to assist him with bringing the unit into the house. I made the deliveryperson wait as the unit was unboxed and had him assist me with placing the TV on its stand. I then powered the unit and verified that the picture was uniform across all parts of the screen and that there were no scratches or other physical flaws to the plastic screen. All was well.I've now has the TV for three days and am pleased with its features and quality. I would recommend Samsung HDTVs and Amazon to anyone.",

I use this as a monitor for Blu-ray, HD DVD and a computer, all connected to HDMI ports on my Yamaha receiver. I've never used the audio built into the television and never watch television.

        "review_text": "The technician just left. It was the power board that was failing progressively. I had the extended warranty with NEW and the first company they set me up with never showed. I called and asked for a different repair company that was closer geographically to my home. They then set me up with Falcones Electronics in Media Pa. They diagnosed the problem over the phone based on my description of what was happening, ordered the power board, and then just came this morning and installed it. My LCD is better than new now. The power board failure got worse over time until it got to the point that the TV would just not turn on. So if you see it getting worse (starts out as pink dots, then stripes, then won't turn on), it's the power board. They told me that without the warranty, it would have run me about $350 to fix. So I'm pleased that the warranty turned out to be a good investment and I'm once again very pleased with this TV. The technician told me that the failure rate on new electronics is about 3% so it's rare. Nonetheless, mine failed but was easily fixed. I paid $1800 for this TV just shy of 2 yrs ago and around $300 for the extended warranty with NEW through Amazon. Despite the initial glitch with NEW and the first company not showing up, not only do I have my TV back and working, I've also now discovered a great little electronics shop for anything else I might need done. I'm just amazed any more when I get good service. Can you tell?",

        "review_text": "In my recent quest to upgrade to HDTV, I got a little over zealous. I originally purchased a 50\" Samsung model HP-S5053 Plasma. When I got it home, it just seemed a bit too large for my living room. After a week, I finally decided I just needed to go with a smaller screen, so I ended up with this 42\" Panasonic, and boy am I glad I made the switch!The picture quality is much nicer and and it is extremely compatible with my cable remote. With the Samsung, I had to use both remotes, but with this one, I only need the cable remote. I'm not a techy type, so I can't speak to the technical aspects of the TV, but I know the picture is outstanding and the TV itself looks more attractive.It has 4 picture size settings. This is my one complaint, but I believe all HD TV's are like this. The first setting leaves bars on the side of the picture. This is the most accurate setting and is necessary to use when watching sporting events. The side bars are a little distracting and take some getting used to. The stretch setting makes people look short and squatty. The zoom one and zoom two settings lose the graphics bars at the top and bottom during sporting events. These are good, however, for watching movies if you don't mind losing the outer perameters of the picture.Overall, I'm very happy with this model. Gotta go now, the football games are coming on.",

He told me HDTV is just better.I got this TV set up just before the Super Bowl. My son, daughter, and son-in-law came over and watched the game at our house. They were all blown away by the picture of this TV! I've since installed surround sound (including in-wall speakers from Amazon) and I find myself drooling while watching TV!

They answered quickly, but sounded like they were reading from a manual that they weren't familiar with and didn't solve my problem of connecting to the internet at all (and I probably spent a total of 4 hours on the phone/computer with them).

        "review_text": "Repaired myself by replacing capacitors as described in the two-part video at [...]. On my unit there were two 10 volt 1000 mf capacitors that were bad. (You can spot them by looking for puffy tops.) They should be replaced with capacitors with a higher voltage rating and the same mf rating. I used 25 volt 1000 mf low ER capacitors sold by Greg Dement on eBay. The set turned on right away, and no vertical lines at all. Just like brand new. Capacitors cost $3.94 for a set of four, plus $2 shipping. There were three 10v 1000 mf capacitors, and I replaced all three, even though only two appeared to be bad. If you're not technically inclined you probably have a relative or friend that can do this job. Took about an hour and that was going slow.I bought a Toshiba 40UX600U while waiting for the capacitors to arrive and also to hedge my bet against the capacitor replacement not working. I love it. Now I have two working 40-inch TVs. I plan to put the repaired Samsung in a lesser-used room. Coincidentally, I also needed to buy a new dishwasher. Samsung makes dishwashers, but I will NEVER, EVER buy Samsung anything again. And I'm telling that to anyone who will listen. I tried the online Samsung repair form but all it kept saying was that it was out of warranty, even though some had success filling it out.

        "review_text": "I was leary purchasing a big ticket item TV over the net and having it delivered. The set arrived, way before the scheduled date, like about 3 or 4 days. It was great, but I didn't have the HD satllite scheduled for another week. didn't look so hot without the hd cable. Just got dish network installed today, and the picture is fantastic. when the TV arrived, the guy delivering was great, helped me bring it up stairs, he turned it on to make sure it worked before I signed for it. The whole process of buying and recieving this size TV was much easier than I would have thought. Amazon is great, and I am extra happy that I got it at $200 bucks less than it is now going for. Can't get too technical, but I really didn't do much to get it going, just plugged it in, set it to the settings that one person on this board advised, (thanks, saved me a lot of time) and that was it. The dish network guy was really good too, set it up without any problem, the picture is really breath taking. I cannot imagine a better picture, I mean, it's like Mt. Rainer is in my living room, can't get any better than that. And all the sport channels look great. football, baseball and even soccer look great. I am watching movies I would never before watch, the picture is so good. Sure glad I did not buy the Sony Grand wega, this beats it all ove the place. Would recommend this Tv. I have a fairly bright room and I don't see any glare, maybe I'm easy, but this whole experience is great. If you're in the market for a hd tv, this one is really worth considering.",

        "review_text": "This 65\" is a good TV, but can be an amazing TV if they gave us more control of the Dimming that's going on. Mostly CE Dimming and Micro Dimming. This 8000 is supposed to have a better Micro Dimming than the lower models, but to me and many others, it's not working and causing clouding and not the best black levels and contrast. I get the feeling that the Micro Dimming Ultimate, is just a marketing tool they use to get consumers to pay the extra money. They did this with the lower end models last year with 3D. They claimed that they had Full HD 3D and really they didn't. Once that was noticed by many consumers, they quickly changed their specs and description and had to take it off all of the boxes. Well, I have a feeling that they did it again with this Dimming feature. Another issue with these 65\" is the quality control. Mine was delivered with a bad pixel in the center of the screen and also Vertical Banding. Those issues are related to the may they are manufactured. At this time, I really cannot recommend this model. At least until they put out a major Firmware update to fix the Dimming issue and auto dimming issue. It's so weird how a lot of the options we had on last years D8000 are no longer there. Black enhancer, edge enhancement, Smart LED.. Basically this model is a lower end compared to last years UND8000 series.. Be Smart!",

It was stunningly clear to say the least. Blacks are deep and artifcating is minimal- the picture just looks good. I don't have a lot of plasma experience but my in-laws recently bought a Samsung HPS4253 and the upscaled SD / DVD picture quality is much better on the Panasonic than that set from what I've seen- an important consideration since most programming is still Standard Definitiion.On top of that, I got this baby for less that I could at a brick and mortar store with no sales tax and free shipping.And the topper for me? Amazon gave me a delivery date of the 11th. EGL [the freight company] gave me a date of the 9th on their web tracker. I got a call on the 4th to set a three hour delivery window on the 5th.I've never been happier with a major purchase.Kudos, Panasonic, Amazon and EGL!",

It certainly makes things simpler and you get a great picture with the built in presets. Let me tell you that this is the TV to beat in terms of audio quality. It is EXCELLENT in that department. The thing gets plenty loud at a low level but at the same time the lowest volume is not overly loud at all. I love it. I don't think I could have made a better choice for the money I paid.

The SMART TV blends the TV guide info from the internet with the antenna channels to provide a \"cable-like\" guide channel that can be used to browse and schedule shows. No DVR though. Display is matted enough not to reflect too much light, although I have to turn off a light that reflects directly into my viewing angle, but no problems in a brightly lit room with a large 8-ft patio door.

The inputs are great, the tv size is perfect for someone who wants a classy design for a good size room. I will say that some tweaking with the picture will have to be done so that it is to your liking, but check the forums out there like [...]for this help, you wont be sorry. The sound could be a little better, but honestly I only notice it with a movie that has a lot of deep bass or something and I have it turned way up. During normal viewing you wont notice anything. May be worth the money to get a surround sound system if you intend on making this your home theater tv...but the picture is absolutely stunning. Best blacks of any LCD that I have found and with some minor tweaking the grayscale is really good, definetly rivals most all Plasma displays. Get an OTA antenna for HD broadcasts for free, use the channel manager for the channels picked up and just enjoy the capability of this TV...excellent buy! Thanks Amazon.",

Next day I noticed 3 lines on right side of TV. Samsung won't repair or replace. Said it is a totally different problem. Well there shouldn't be any problems. No more samsung for me. $1600 down the drain. Well after much arguing back and forth with Samsung they sent someone out to look at my TV again. They told me it was a bad panel but they are going to replace. I am thankful they are replacing but a tv should last much longer than 2 1/2 years. Even the tv repair man said if Samsung was not going to cover I should just go buy a new TV. He said a panel replacement can be $1000.00",

The smart TV is awesome, I love that it has built in Wi-Fi which allowed me to connect to my Hulu, Netflix, and MLB accounts and also running Windows 7 on my home computers has allowed me to view and listen to all my network shared media. I also love the iPhone App which allows me to control the smart TV better than the supplied remote. All this and I haven't even mentioned the 3D content. A really cool feature. Right now Comcast provides 2 channels and on-demand content, everyone I have shown the TV to wants one! Pandora runs great, drops into screensaver mode as it runs so no screen burning. I found myself letting this run during the day, makes for great background atmosphere as you do your chores. I also picked up a wireless kybd/mouse which to my surprise the TV immediately recognized and connected to. Makes using the browser functional. Ok, so now the bad as nothing is perfect. The remote control does not allow you to control other devices so you will need to continue to use your other remotes. I find the Smart TV feature slow to start up at times and the general operation of this feature rich TV is kind of overwhelming for my wife who is technically challenged. The sound is OK depending on the content you are watching / listening to. I found it to be low on some of my movies. It would be much better if you could jump in an out of the apps so you could multi-task but right now If I want to watch a game on MLB and also on cable I have to exit and restart the MLB app.",

I made many comparisons before the purchase and am still making comparisons to this day every time I view another plasma/lcd set. I can honestly say that this set blows anyhting away that I have seen in a store or in another home.Panasonic hit a grand slam with this set. It is not 1080p but with thie 720p/1080i it is still magnificent and out perfroms any 1080p set I have seen. (except for maybe the Panasonic 1080p set) This is my opinion and it may appear biased but I feel strongly about this. I use it with a Toshiba A-3 HD-DVD player and get perfect picures there and with the HD television I receive. If you are in the market for this, get this while they are still available.",

        "review_text": "We've had this set for about a year and a half now and we really enjoy it. My only real regret is not getting a bigger screen, but my wife didn't want a set too large for our smallish living room. However, she was pleasantly surprised at how nice this \"piano black\" Samsung looked there and we both just love watching TV on it, expecially in HD. Even the remote looks and feels stylish.My one criticism is with the 2 zoom modes. \"Zoom 1\" should back off just a little...it cuts off a little more than it needs to to optimize a wide-screen standard def picture. \"Zoom 2\" is completely useless.BTW, as far as I can tell this set does not do 1080i, just 720p. This has not been an issue thus far, as all HD programming we get is 720p, but there will be a BluRay player in its future, which does 1080p and it would be nice to know we're getting the highest res picture there is...but again, this matters less on a smaller TV like this.For the 8 feet average distance from our couch to the set, I think a 42 inch would be perfect, so I've started poking around at the latest Sharp Aquos 42\", and for not much more than the $900 or so we paid for this, you get a 10 inch bigger screen, 1080p, twice as fast response time and slightly better contrast ratio in a fairly compact package. This would bump the Sharp into a smaller room in the house which would work better for a 32\".",

My only problem was that I needed to narrow it down because there are so many different models. I knew that 1080p was the way to go, so that helped a little, but by comparing the different sony models side by side at a local store, I found that this model was the second best in the lineup. Just a notch below the XBR this television gives a great quality picture and tons of features. I especially like the customization and setup options available on the sony model I purchased. It allows you to really set the unit up how you want it. The only minor complaint I have is that in 480i mode, when the tv is turned on, it will default to 4:3 instead of 16:9 like I have specified in the setup. A quick change to an HD signal and back fixes it, so it is only a minor annoyance. Otherwise it has worked flawlessly for me in the month that I have owned it.",

They brought it in, unpacked it and they were right on time.Now for the TV itself.The picture is absolutely perfect. There are many detailed settings for color preferences but don't let that scare you. I had my TV plugged in and the color tuned in to my taste within 10 minutes.The clarity of the picture is great and the color is superb. The high contrast ratio probably rivals any plasma. The blacks are black and the whites are white. I would higly recommend this TV to anyone in the market for full 1080p hd. Don't even waste your time looking at a 720p. Spend a few extra bucks and get full HD.I looked at comparable TVs from Toshiba, Sharp, Sony. None of them matched the features or picture of this TV though they cost more money in some cases. For the money, the features, this is the one to buy.The only problem I have is that now Amazaon is offering the same TV for $100 less just 10 days after I bought it. Hey, I'm still happy because compared to local stores, I still saved about $400.Buy it now!",

Rest assured, this TV is very bright and is easily viewed even during the brightest part of the day. Yes, it is highly reflective, but the light doesn't scatter when it hits the screen, so the overall picture isn't washed out like it can be with LCDs and edge-lit LEDs. What about burn-in/image retention? I've had this set for three weeks, just past the critical 100-hour stage where image retention and burn-in typically occur. This set does an outstanding job, I've yet to see the slightest hint of image retention, and I've been looking for it. Having an older plasma that did have IR I know what to look for. The colors and black levels of this set are excellent, it's like seeing HD for the first time all over again. Of course, the viewing angle of plasma is best in the business as well, so no problems there. All in all it's hard to find fault with this TV. I gave it 4 stars for features because it does not offer any sort of internet or \"smart\" connectivity. This was perfect for me since I already have a Roku, and I was able to save a significant amount by choosing a TV without those features. I believe this TV is the best bargain in the TV industry in 2013. If image quality and a good value are important to you, then you should definitely give this Samsung a chance.",

Even if you spend some dollar more compare to other TV's but it's worth it. It's my third SONY TV now and most likely I will stay with this brand. If you go into the big stores and see all of these TVs on display than you are starting comparing the different pictures. When you finally found the best pictures you can be sure it's a SONY.It's easy to setup and have many connections.The only thing I really miss is a real switch off. The TV is always on Stand-By which I don't like. It would safe some energy with a real switch-off.But that's it, what I miss.",

        "review_text": "The LNT4065 TV produces amazing pictures with vibrant colors. Sound from TV is decent. Remote, when compared to my Panasonic plasma is poorly designed. When it comes to picture quality, this LCD beats all its competitors hands down . The piano black finish combined with the glossy screen is very mesmerizing to look at. This TV handles glare with ease. I have my TV in a room that has 4 windows and a large patio door with a lot of sunlight coming in. Glare is never a problem. (Plasmas can't handle glare this well).Purchased the LNT4065 thru Amazon. Amazon is a pleasure to deal with and delivers the best value for your money. Amazingly quick ( TV was delivered in 3 days even though they say it will take 10 days) and FREE delivery via Eagle Shipping. I read some reviews that complained about Eagle Shipping. Let's just keep in mind that we are getting free shipping from Amazon, plus tax free low price. If the delivery guy does not smile, no big deal. As long as he delivers the TV in good shape, and in the time window promised, I am happy. Also, there was a price drop two weeks after I purchased. I called customer service and they did refund me the difference.Originally purchased the LNT4061 40\" from Amazon. Was not happy with the picture quality. Returned the LNT4061 to Amazon and got a full refund in 7 days. Shipping was free both ways. Amazon sent Eagle Shipping to my home to pick it up. The guy helped me pack it up - WOW! Amazon beats store purchase experience on all counts. This is true only when the product is sold by Amazon. Some times it is sold by a partner. You probably won't get free shiping if you buy from a partner. So pay attention to the partners shipping policy before you place the order.Over all, if you are in the market for a 40\" LCD TV, LNT4065 in my opinion is the undisputed champion!!",

        "review_text": "This is my second Samsung. I bought it based on positive experience with my first 26\" Samsung. Anyway, shortly after setup, a high-pitched squeeling noise developed. It wasn't noticable all the time, but it kept returning under various conditions. It seemed to come from the lower left hand side from rear of the unit. Besides squealing, the stand leaned to the left and no adjustments available. Overall, nice picture, beautiful design, easy to use, but the screeching will give you a migrane. Returned it and bought a 32\" Sony Bravia XBR (KDL32XBR4) for a few $$ more. Be sure to look for the XBR4 model because it has Motionflow 120Hz speed and 10-bit processing. HD is absolutely amazing on the XBR4. The KDL32XBR4 is by far the best 32\" set on the market. Check it out and compare the Sony side-by-side before you purchase this 32\" Samsung.",

I never thought I'd end up making a major acquisition like this from Amazon or any online retailer, but it had the lowest price on this set by far (several hundred dollars), free delivery, and no taxes. And, the delivery service was better than expected. Amazon uses the same people who do Crutchfield's \"white glove\" deliveries. I just wish there were more HD channels...",

        "review_text": "I bought this product for the included cleaning cloth but the TV was a great addition! I don't know that much about LCD/Plasma TV's, but I do know that watching 1080p blu-rays on this is spectacular on this TV--watching Apocolypto was mesmerizing during the human sacrifices. You could see each person's face perfectly in the crowd down below from way up on the sacrificial pyramid thing! It almost ruined the effect because instead of seeing a crowd of angry, blood-thirsty, and heart-hungry people you saw a whole bunch of individuals jumping up and down like fools. This TV's clarity is unbelievable!I also have a PS3 (bought it originally from Amazon, but their lack of regard to my problems--although I am accustomed to good service here--made me want to give even this TV 0 stars!) and 1080P games like Ridge Racer, NBA 2k7, and Virtua Tennis look mesmerizing. When I was playing NBA 2k7 on the PS3 my dad came in, watched the TV casually for a minute, and then said, \"Wait, this is a video game???\"Anyway, enough about the PS3... I will now try to crank out some bad things about this TV. *fifteen minutes later* Ok, I thought of two. The TV's glossy panels collect dust (cleaning cloth covers that) and the TV takes a few seconds to start up. Also, in the category of glossiness, the screen WILL glare if you have a lamp on behind you (obviously), so you will want to change your lighting accordingly. It handles natural light well, but you can't expect it to be unaffected by a lightbulb.Eagle shipped this TV in an excruciating 8 days--but still, I guess they made the deadline. (Although, seeing as it only had to come from PA to NJ, and it arrived in a town near me in 4 days, this still a bit dissapointing.)Dust and EGL aside, buy this TV!",

Within 15 minutes I was watching beatiful HD programs on my Samsung TV. (Note I already had HD service from my cable company). By the way, the Amazon salespeople were helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. At first I was reluctant about purchasing the TV over the internet. However they made they made me feel at ease.There is so much more good things that I could say about my purchase but I have to go.

Understand that this TV is going to have a higher resolution than most of the signals you will send it. We have the system hooked up to DISH HD, a Playstation 2 and a Zenith DVD/VCR combo. The DISH HD output looks pretty good via HDMI. The Playstation 2 output is as good as you can get from a Playstation 2. The Zenith output is often pixelated and grainy. That's what happens when you mix and match old technology with new technology. I can live with it but consumers have a responsibility to understand that this TV will not make your old videotapes look better. In fact, they will look worse. So will DVDs unless you invest in progressive scan.The TV itself is well designed with an excellent picture (depending on source quality). Blacks look pretty black and we have experienced none of the blurring some older LCD TV owners complain about. Only one thing about this unit irritates me - the control on the right side of the TV itself. They are very hard to read. If you'll be using a remote exclusively it won't be a problem.Overall I look forward to years of happy ownership.",

        "review_text": "I read lots of reviews of this TV as well as others, and yes, the TV is gorgeous. Regarding sound, I think Samsung made the right compromise. It's completely fine for a small room; if you have a big room, you have space for a more extensive sound system.What I actually want to review is Amazon's service. I found them offering this TV not at the lowest price on the web, but lowest among any dealers I had ever heard of. Read dealer reviews; there are lots of horror stories.We live in suburban Dallas and placed the order for this TV with Amazon at 11:30 AM on 2/20, with an estimated delivery date 2/26 - 2/28, and received notice at 4:09 PM that same day that it had shipped. Tracking the shipment showed it was actually picked up in Cincinnati at noon, departed there at 8:00 PM, and arrived in Dallas on 2/22 at 11:21 AM.We were called that day by Eagle to arrange delivery for Saturday morning 2/24, and when I hesitated (due to a full schedule), they offered Friday afternoon. My wife, on the phone at the time, and I both jumped at that chance. The TV arrived and was set in place in our house at 4:15 PM on 2/23. I had the guys wait a few minutes while I verified it worked, then they were on their way.Sorry for the long story, but consider:* Great TV* Great Price* Great Service, with free shipping!What's not to like??? Great job, Amazon!",

However, we were really struck by the picture, color, and overall quality of this 50\" LED set when we compared it to other similar makes and models. Also, we got a great deal on the set from the store we bought it from. After making the purchase, we had the set delivered and installed in our home just a couple of days ago. I can't begin to tell you how happy we've been. The picture has such great quality that I almost feel that the people on television are standing in the room with us. It's also nice to have a bigger screen compared to our previous television which was only 35\". The bigger screen is a welcome addition and adds so much more to watching television and enjoying movies at home. Also, the sound quality is great as well. The built-in speakers project sound really well into the room. Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and love our new television from Samsung. It has proven to be a perfect choice for our home.",

        "review_text": "I purchased this LNT4665F just over a month ago and I am very pleased with it. I had difficulty deciding betweeen this model, the LNT4661, and the new 120Hz LNT4671F, but I am very pleased with my choice. The LNT4671F was $500 more, and I felt the only advantage was brighter colors. I don't see any pixel blurring with my LNT4665F, which the 120Hz feature of the LNT4671F is supposed to improve. I actually had to turn down the brightness and contrast of my LNT4665F as it was more than I needed for our living room.Regarding LNT4665F vs the LNT4661, and after seeing them side-by-side at BestBuy, it was a no brainer for me. One reason I chose the LNT4665F instead is because the LNT4661 is an older generation, and for only $70 more, I was able to get this next generation Samsung (basically meaning darker blacks and better contrast). One concern I had with the LNT4665F before I purchased it was the glossy screen, whereas the LNT4661 has a matte finish. Some reviewers claim the LNT4665F is too shiny, and maybe it is for a living room with a lot of light. I would say my living room has average to slightly higher than average ambient light, as well as overhead canned lights, but the only time I notice the reflection is when I am purposefully trying to notice the reflection on dark scenes. If you have a lot of light and you want virtually zero reflection, go with the LNT4661. However, if you want darker blacks and a crisper picture, go with the LNT4665F. I also think the LNT4665F looks nicer when turned off because of its glossy screen and housing.The only downside of this TV, and it is a very small downside, is the speakers. They are on the bottom side of TV, and with my tilting mount, they face my wall, causing the sound quality to be lower than it should. However, I have a keen ear for sound quality and most may not be able to tell the difference -- my wife doesn't. That said, with a surround sound system, it doesn't matter.Thanks,Matt",

It is connected to our DishTV HDTV box via a 50' component cable. The very good looking swivel stand and small black frame are nice, but hiding the speakers in back slightly compromised the sound quality compared to my old TV. A little hollow sounding.

I have been playing around with it for almost 3 weeks now and still I am not very satisfied. The bad part is I know that this TV can really give the best picture quality but unfortunately as a customer, it is really very difficult to set up the tv to get the best picture out of it. The same applies for 3D as well, the set up is a pain. Coming to the smart TV, it has loads of options available but the performance is very slow and you need to wait for a few seconds after clicking on the icons. A couple of times the tv just hung when you click the buttons faster in the remote. All in all, this is a tv with great features but limited performance.",

Now, the normal TV sound is great; it's only during loud action scenes in movies or the bass on Guitar Hero that I noticed some \"white noise\" like sounds (keep in mind VERY MINOR) I just hooked up my Logitech X230 computer speakers after buying an $8 adaptor and the sound/bass is amazing. **Keep in mind, I tend to be a stickler for sound so this problem might not be a problem for the TV watcher, or the normal person. however, if you are like me, the speakers I got on Amazon for $30 and only $8 for adaptors make an awesome surround sound imitation**Overall, if I could do it again, I would still go with the 32HL67U. If i had to recomend a TV to a friend/family member, i would suggest the 32HL67U. It's a win-win senario with a very resonable price.Do yourself a favor, stop reading reviews and make it happen.",

I called Samsung and they said take it in for service. The diagnosis was bad lcd screen , probably bad circuit board. The cost of repair is more than the cost of a new tv. I paid 699.00 for this set and now it is worthless. There are so many complaints on the same issue with Samsung tvs . I wish there was some remedy for this but the only recourse is to spread the word dont buy Samsung..They will not stand behind their product after one year!",

        "review_text": "After doing alot of price comparison, bang for your buck type stuff, I initially chose the 40\" but my order got declined due to a 1000$ limit on my Master Card debit card. So, I submitted it directly through my bank account and Amazon didn't even attempt to process it and just canceled the order, dissapointing. That's when I busted out the AMEX, called them and authorized the amount(gotta love 24/7 c/s) and went ahead and ordered the 46\".That was all done on Tuesday 02/19. Last night around midnight, much to my suprise, I saw that Eagle USA(www.cevalogistics.com now) had picked up my shipment in DALLAS at the Amazon warehouse at 3:45pm on 2/21 but had a delivery date of 2/29. Confused I called them at 1.800.888.4949 at 4am and they answered! They said they had picked it up from the Amazon warehouse and it was now in the Eagle warehouse in Grapevine, 6 freaking miles from my house. The rep said they were open 24/7 and I could even pick it up, so off I went.The building had a big E-G-L blue sign on it, so was kinda hard to find. Went through security and to the docking bay, gave them my tracking # and ID and they went with a forklift and got my TV. He said it was brand new and they had JUST gotten the shipment in, package was in great condition with absolutely no blimeshes so I didn't even bother opening it. Strapped it in my truck and took it home. It was almost too heavy to carry in, akward box, but I got it.After unboxing it and examining its exterior for roughly 40 minutes I only found one blemish, probably during manufacturing but not caused by Amazon or EGL, a small scratch on the top of the bezel. Invisible if your not looking for it, but merit enough to mention. The screen was in prestine condition scratch wise, just a bit of dirt/smudge on the topright that easily wiped off.Upon turning it on I spent another 40 minutes searching for dead pixels, discoloration, clouding, or any signs of defect, none were found. I didn't have an antenna yet, getting one tonight, so didn't get to scan for signals so I can't say what that is like yet. Going through the initial setup was painful, the menus are so painfully slow it makes you not want to even calibrate the color/contrast/brightness/etc. Calibration is requied, especially in \"Game mode\" as it looks horrible until you adjust the settings.I haven't finished calibrating it yet, but so far I'm extremely impressed. The level of detail, with 1080p HDMI, over my 24\" Dell 2405fpw in Lost Odyssey is amazing(720p over component). In the beginning of the game lava pours down from the sky, with the Samsung I can see every single person on the battlefield running away from it, never even noticed them on the Dell. Playing COD4 on PS3 is just as rewarding, especially sitting only 6 feet back, it's like having my own theatre. Not even going to comment on the sound, if you got the money to spend on this tv you shouldn't be using it's built in speakers. I use Onkyo 5.1 system, sounds good enough for my room. In our living room we have a 720p HD70 Optoma projector that we sit about 12 feet back from, sitting back 6 feet from the Samsung is roughly equivalent for realestate size for the screens, and it is every bit as enthralling. A real cenematic experience, I am happy with my purchase and definately reccomend it.The entire purchase was a good experience, no delivery horror stories. But, I was definately weary and was glad I was able to pick up the TV myself, was a relief. If anyone in the DFW plans on purchasing this TV, good chances are you can pick it up yourself the very next day at the warehouse. After I've had it a while I'll write another review.",

This one is even better than the LN 4095 with more features and more inputs. One big surprise, it even decode some of the digital HD channels from my analog cable.

Glare is not a problem in my frequently bright room. You never feel like it's a mirror.The set is very thin at 3\" and the rear inputs are recessed allowing me to use a 1\" thick wall mount without crushing the connectors.You can attach a USB memory stick with still pictures and the set will display them pretty well. It's cool but not full 1080p resolution and the big jpeg images from current digicams take maybe 5 seconds to appear after selected. Pretty slow.

        "review_text": "Ok, so I bought this thing from Amazon.com on December 28, 2007 and it found itself in my home about a week or so later. Before I talk about the TV itself, a word on the shipping. This was one of the most unique shipping experiences I have had for a product such as this. Normally for things like furniture and appliances, you have someone come in and install everything for you and make sure everything is cool. Well, assuming Amazon still has it, you get that same type of service with this TV...for free!!! The guy came into my house, unpacked my TV, put it together, and stuck around to ensure that the TV was not defective and in working order. No offense to UPS, as they are great, but you won't get that service from them. Anyhow, on to the TV.Wow! I agonized over my decision to get a TV because it is obviously a costly investment and you don't want to screw it up and have to go through the trouble of undoing it. I was basically set on Samsung's LN-T3253H, but I had a bit of trouble agreeing on the price that retailers such as Best Buy, Circuit City, and even Amazon.com wanted me to pay for it. So I searched past the letter 'S' and went on to 'T' to find this diamond in the rough. The price was very right and it consistently scored over a 4.5 on all the websites I visited. After going to the store to look at it side by side with that aforementioned Samsung, I wasn't quite sold....until an hour later. I want you to be very careful when choosing a TV that is very bright and pretty. Initially it looks nice, ala the LN-T3253H, but after looking at this one some more, I saw that it does the color black extremely well. Something I thought was questionable on the Samsung. As a matter of fact, the full spectrum looks very well done as the contrast between the color is very vivid and believable. While Toshiba does not list the contrast ratio of this set, it's easy to see that it is very good. Also, this TV comes with all the ports you will need for today's current applications.There are 3 HDMI ports, 1 composite AV input, 2 component input, 1 audio output, a digital audio output, 1 S-video input, an antenna input, and a PC input, which has become one of my favorites. If you hook your computer or even your laptop up to this, you will be amazed by the picture quality and probably would not want to use your main screen again. The sound, while not jaw dropping, is good/very good. Of course, hooked up to a sound system and it all sounds verrry nice. Coupled with a very good to almost great looking HD picture and you have a TV that does what it is supposed to do at this price point very well. Of course, standard def broadcasts and media takes a little hit in quality, but if you sit far enough back, it actually looks better than the 4:3 aspect ratio TV you had prior...at least in my case. I could go on here, but that would bore you. Bottom line is that this is one of the best, if not the best 32 inchers on the market. You could go with Sony, and by all means, if you are willing to spend the extra cash do so, but that would not be necessary as this TV is just as capable as any Sony 32 inch you can buy. I got mine for $684 directly from Amazon. The price has gone up since then, but I think that it is still worth it. Pay with your platinum Visa/Mastercard and you should be able to double the manufacturer's warranty. Same with American Express (check your card member agreements to make sure). Buy with confidence and sit back and enjoy!",

The matte screen does reduce the contrast and dark detail a little bit comparing to 4665, 4671, and Sony, but is the right choice for our bright living room.The on TV speakers are average. Without a sound system, I plugged in a subwoofer to boost the base, and can feel the improvement. Heard the digital audio output can not pass 5.1sound, which is a minus, although I am not using it for the moment.Connecting to my laptop and it is a great monitor for watching pictures, movies and play games. I do need to use the VGA port (or HDMI port, not tested) to get full HD resolution, the S-video only support up to 1024x768 resolution.The response time of the TV to the remote is a bit slow, but acceptable.Amazon has the best price, and I have got $130 refund due to price reduction with in the month I having the TV. $500 less than Bestbuy. I have also got a free universal remote and expecting a $100 NFL certificate as part of the deal.The delivery experience was better than expected. The unit came a few days early than Amazon's estimate, arrived 7 days after ordering. Two persons show up on time and set the TV up on the TV stand, turned it on with the remote and allowed my to inspect throughly before sign the paperwork.",

        "review_text": "Here is the tip that you probably didn't know. So not only was the initial price ($2049) lower than the local retailer. And not only was shipping free. And not only was the tax free. And not only did I get multiple $25 gift cards because I used my Amazon credit card.But Amazon has a policy that you can call up unlimited times and get a price reduction if you see a lower price on the product. So I bought my TV for $2049 on Nov 1. A week or so later, it had dropped to $1999 and I called and they credited my account. I set a reminder in my work Outlook to check every day at lunch. It dropped again to $1949. Call. Refund. I definitely made sure to check on Black Friday. And Black Monday. And again. Call. Refund. And again.So in the end for me the price has dropped from $2049 to $1799, saving me $250 off my original price. Oh, and my friend's TV dropped $50, my HD DVD player dropped $10, and even my wall bracket dropped $20.But wait you say, I don't have time to sit on hold all that time. Well, you don't. If you go to Amazon's help page, there is a feature called \"Call me now.\" You type in your phone number and literally 5 seconds later, your phone rings with a live person on the other end, and 2 minutes later you have your savings. And no, I don't work for Amazon. Like I said, I'm the bargain guy, and I know every trick to get a good price. And if one end of the spectrum is creepy commissioned salespeople in Manhattan and the other is a flawless customer experience, it's a no brainer.All this would be irrelevant if the performance didn't live up to the hype. Well, it does. In a word, the TV is stunning. End of story.",

At night a do have some glare due to my table lamps reflecting off of the shiny black trim, I would prefer it to be a flat black. The purchase through Amazon was perfect. As the price has dropped over the past few weeks, Amazon has credited my credit card with the price difference. My only complaint I have is that it took about 2 weeks to get the TV, but that is really no issue. Due to the fact that the white glove delivery only came to my city once a week tacked on another 7 days for it to be delivered, but the whole transaction was easy and I am very satisfied with the LCD and Amazon. Don't hesitate to buy this LCD and to buy it through Amazon. Hesitation will only lead to additional days you don't have this fantastic LCD.",

Ok, I wish I could have afforded to buy a larger screen, but I'm still very happy with the 46 inch. I researched 3d HDTVs for months after getting a demonstration from a friend of the TV's capabilities. He purchased a similar Samsung 3D HDTV and blew me away with what I saw. I was stunned by the picture quality and equally stunned at the quality of the 3D. Years ago I had seen a demostration of a 3D rear projection HDTV and I wasn't impressed by the quality of the 3D. Boy, times have sure changed. My research of 3D HDTVs included all of the major popular brands and I even watched all of the CNET reviews online for all of the HDTVs. The 3D quality of this HDTV is STUNNING! I mean it! STUNNING! On numerous occasions I caught myself ducking to avoid 3D objects hurtling my way from the screen! Stunning picture quality and stunning 3D. Well worth the purchase! When paired with a Samsung 3D Blu Ray player be prepared to see some stunning HD picture quality! Please note that the 2d-3d converson is so-so, but hey, its not real 3D. Look, if you want to watch 3D then watch it in 3D. 2d-3d is basically a gimmick. The Smart TV apps are great but I will be purchasing a wireless keyboard because on screen keyboard is a hassle to use with the remote.",

        "review_text": "I purchased the 40V3000 directly from Amazon purely because of the price and the fact that it was a Sony. I paid $1201 with free shipping, all other stores were offering this unit on sale at $1699. I could not find a better TV with the same options and size for less than $1400. The overall quality of this TV is fantastic, even without HD. Colors are true, picture is sharp and the sound is awesome. When we first hooked it up to our SD Directv dish the picture was a little fuzzy, found out that the RF type cable I was using between the TV and DTV box was junk. Switched to RCA type cables and the picture improved. Today, we are adding HD from DTV and all the cables and boxes are being replaced. I cant imagine a picture better than what we already have. My only advice is to watch the price at Amazon, I have seen it go as low as $1201 (which is what we paid) to a high of $ 1548 in a one week period. Shipping was extremely fast. I ordered on Sunday expecting it to ship monday from PA. We were contacted on Tuesday saying the TV was in the local Boston warehouse and ready for delivery. The unit was delivered Wednesday afternoon by Eagle Freight. The driver told us that delivery included unpacking the unit and plugging it it to make sure it work and was not damage. Overall, great TV and great price and service from Amazon...",

In this instance you get some tracing effects, but I understand that that is a problem with all lcds, and sony has minimized the amount of this compared to other name brands. I went to sams, circuit city, bset buy, and did all kinds of research online. This tv was the best picture that I could afford, and i got a great deal on it. The tv speakers are outstanding as well, they almost sound as good as my surround sound system. My biggest complaint is the remote this tv comes with. If you are shelling out over a 1000 dollars for a tv, I really feel that you should get a universal remote. Also, there is no easy setup on the remote for the Pip. I think that I will use the old remote that came with my previous sony tv, b/c it has the pip easy access, and is a universal remote. Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase, I really thought that i was going to be disappointed because I have always been more of a tube tv fan, even though they are heavy, I got an awesome picture from my 1080i Sony that just shut down.

Also, between the time we purchased the TV and the time it was delivered the price went down, and Amazon very happily credited me the difference. I was so taken with all the reviews that said Eagle would bring in the TV and plug it in to be sure it worked! NOT! In fact, the driver of the truck was so scared of the public road to our house that my husband had to go meet them and ask them to come with him to be sure it worked. The driver said there was no way they do that - even tho the dispatcher who had scheduled the delivery said that they would. Never again would I buy anything that used Eagle.",

        "review_text": "After much research and having had good luck with Samsung TVs before, I decided on this model. The picture was good from directly in front of the screen, but suffered while viewing from off-angles. The major problem with the unit was the lack of Dolby Digital while using an HDMI source. I tried to connect the TV to the surround receiver (using the SPDIF optical output on the back of the TV) but PCM stereo was the only audio format option. Dolby Digital and DTS were \"grayed out\" and not available to be chosen when using any format, including HDMI, other than a coaxial line. Surprising that this TV would be engineered to not allow Dolby Digital as an audio format coming from HDMI since that's the latest and most efficient method of hooking up an HD cable box to the TV. This was a deal breaker for me, as this TV was to be the central unit of a home theater system. I had to send the TV back and move my old LNT4671F back into the room.",

(I live a considerable distance from the nearest large city, hence the extra days) The TV worked amazingly well right out of the box. I connected it to my outdoor antenna and immediately began to receive clear, sharp, over-the-air HDTV broadcasts from our local repeater (translater) station. After a few minor adjustments to contrast, brightness, and tint, to suit my personal preferences, I was ready to go. Next, I connected my progressive-scan DVD player through the S-video input, popped in a DVD, and was impressed by what I saw on the screen.Having noticed that the price of the HL-S4666W had dropped between the time I placed the order and when it was shipped, I contacted Amazon customer service to request a credit for the difference. They promptly and courteously responded to my request, and indicated that a credit would indeed be applied to my VISA account.I, like most individuals contemplating the purchase of a relatively expensive consumer electronics item, have paid close attention to user opinions and feedback, and accordingly, had been somewhat alarmed by a few of the comments regarding the quality of this product and its performance, as well as Amazon's shipping and customer service.

The picture is so gorgeous It sometimes distracts me from the action/plot --\"wow, look at that mural on the wall\" or \"What colors on that hillside\". We have 4 windows in the room and no glare.

Remember that there are places out there that let you return your tv up until 30 days - at amazon they deliver and hook it up - if it works - then after that it is up to you. Breaks on day 2 - you deal with Samsung. Trust me, you DO NOT want to deal with their customer service department, I spent a whole summer attempting to get a different Samsung fixed.Nonetheless, I purchased this tv because 1080p tv's are twice the price and if you want a good tv - wait until 1080p LCD's lower in price down to the 2500k range. Currently they are around 4000k. For the price, you get a decent HDTV that is light and easy to move around. Good buy, just be careful where you buy from.",

        "review_text": "I got this TV around Thanksgiving 2007 for a really^2 good deal.I'm very satisfied w/ the product; extremely good picture quality, no dead pixels. I also like grand look of this TV - piano black panel, SRS sounds real, up-converted DVD looks stunning, plenty of custom settings available, though default settings produce great picture quality, Stable Sound works well for cable TV, but I turn it off if I'm gonna watch a DVD.I purchased this based on the technical specifications, Amazon customer reviews and Consumer Report - this TV is one of the 2007 best LCD. I tried to look at the TV at local retailers, but among all LCDs turned on, this TV was turned off ??? I ordered it anyway. Then, b4 the TV arrived, I got the chance to see the TV side by side with Sony. I don't see the difference. Since the panel is piano-black, I can see if the TV produces \"real\" black or not. Yes, the TV is capable of displaying black quite well. Night scenes are great. Watching 300 (Spartans) on this TV is GREAT!!!This TV has 14-bit digital video processor, and I believe, it outputs 10 bits. What it means is you get more levels/combinations of colors. For example, you will see the orange as orange, not red or yellow. Contrast Ratio? It's got enough to see those night scenes in 300 movie clearly. Blacks are real blacks, not grayish black.Sound - simply great! those virtual surround sound actually works, of course if you sit in front of the TV. 3D sound effects are also great.Size- yes, this TV is a bit bulkier than its competitors. But it's more loaded, technically.Resolution - 720p is enough for a 32\" LCD TV because you will not see the difference between 1080p and 720p on a 32\" TV from a 6-9 feet distance. But if you gonna go for more than 37\", consider 1080p.I compared technical specifications of different TVs in this price range and size. To me, this Toshiba TV seems to be more technically sophisticated. Compared to XBR4, they both have similar video processing power but XBR4 offer 120Hz which is good for sport-fan. Unless you are willing to pay twice, you might wanna get the REGZA.Overall, this TV is of very high value. You get more the bucks.",

Regular local channels using the little HD antenna @ radioshack 4 $30 show amazing picture too (KCAL9, KTLA5, ABC7...). I've never thought local free channels would look this great before buying this TV.Awesome picture quality. I plug the SD card USB reader into the USB port to view the pictures I took with my Canon SD800 IS and the picture just beautiful. It also plays mp3 file(s) if you have it on the memory card as background music while displaying the slideshow. So forget those 7-10\" digital picture frames, this one does the same thing in much much bigger size.PC input great too, very sharp and clear just like a regular monitor. Resolution of 1920x1080 give really really huge space to work with although I would prefer allowance of 1280x768 to make all the display, fonts... bigger so I can surf the web at 10 feet away instead of having to move closer to the TV everytime I'm surfing the web.Overall, very happy with this TV. My wife loves it too, making this buying another win win for me :)",

        "review_text": "I was comparison shopping for this unit, and wanted to know any significant design variations throughout the product line. Budget vs mid-level vs high-end.So I called Toshiba for clarification. The customer service representative was knowledgeable, and easily answered my questions.I began reading the 32HL67U description, and discovered several specifications for the audio output were overlooked on Toshiba's web site. So, I called Toshiba again for further clarification.This time, I felt like I was playing Stump-the-Dummy. I was amazed the customer service representative couldn't even answer the simple question, \"What type of audio out jack is used?\" I began to wonder if he could even comprehend what I was asking. So after rephrasing the question several times, I asked to speak with someone else, and stated we (he and I) were not communicating effectively. The customer service representative had the audacity to tell me \"I wasn't speaking effectively!\" I was completely taken by suprise with his rude comment, but quickly responded with an appropriate reply.The third time I called back to speak with a supervisor. I was denied! The customer service representative stated I would have to divulge my identity and contact information before a supervisor would even consider talking to me. So I gave fictitious information, and was told it wasn't good enough because it didn't \"seem\" real.In my opinion, Toshiba has deplorable customer service, and this incident definitely cost them my business!A reasonalbe person would have to wonder, if Toshiba's customer service is rude and useless BEFORE the sale, then how bad is it AFTER the sale? ...that is, once they have your money!To be fair, the 32HL67U most likely has some good points, as evidenced by the 5-Star reviews.PS. The audio out is fixed Dolby Digital 5.1 via an optical jack. ;-)Hope this helps!",
